    'The Ministry of Energy has said Frances Essiam’s attack on the Minister, Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh is a misdirection of anger.\n\nFrances Essiam speaking on her sack from the Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing company as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) blamed Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh for her woes.\n\nShe said the minister had challenges with a state agency that had opted to support the Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing company in its drive to expand but Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh had his own plans and therefore will not agree to her agreements reached with a state agency of her choice.\n\n"...with all our hard work and efforts at the company, there are some who don’t want us to be successful...so I’ve decided to resign. I’m a woman of substance, a woman of peace and highly knowledgeable... I have resigned so Dr. Mathew Opoku Prempeh, Minister for Energy and Manhyia South MP can now have his way; he can do whatever he wants with Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing Company; he can grind and chew it ... I have not heard from the President but I am resigning in principle... he (Mathew Opoku Prempeh) should bring it on, I am ready for him,” she said. \n\nBut a Communications Specialist at the Ministry of Energy, Kofi Abrefa Afena has disclosed Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh neither appointed nor fired Madam Frances as she claimed.\n\nHe indicated the rants of Frances Asiam “Is a clear case of misdirected anger and he will not be dragged into that hullabaloo. I believe Madam Frances can pick up any challenges she has with the termination of her appointment with the appointing authority”.\n\nArguing that since Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh took over as Energy Minister, he has “supported and guided the agency heads to the best of his ability and he will continue to do so, for the good of Mother Ghana”.',

Our statements and behaviour should motivate people . . . if you are a Minister, you have to be sensitive to the Ghanaian people," he advised.\n\nHe urged the delegates to engage in a lifestyle audit whenever an aspirant offers them money in exchange for votes.\n\n"Sometimes, even the party people should be asking how they are getting those monies," he said.\n\nMr. Kwabena Agyei Agyepong also admonished his colleague aspirants to discourage vote-buying stressing "politics is not a job but a calling", hence seeking to be elected should be an act of service to the people.',
    'A senior lecturer at the University Ghana Political Science Department, Dr. Kwame Asah Asante has said that the country will be able to forgo the IMF bailout and its conditions if the government manages corruption well.\n\nGhana officially contacted the International Monetary Fund to seek financial support. The external creditors provided Ghana with a certain criterion the country must meet to secure a possible $3 billion bailout.\n\nThe government introduced the Domestic Debt Exchange Program (DDEP) to restructure debt as part of the steps to reach board-level approval with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a $3 billion facility to restore macroeconomic stability in the country.\n\nThe government targeted 80% participation in the program to help restructure 137.3 billion Ghana cedis in bonds on the domestic market to bring its total debt, which stands at about 575.5 billion Ghana cedis to sustainable levels.\n\nSpeaking on Morning Starr the Political Scientist said that the government’s mismanagement of corruption is the reason we need to accept all these conditionalities from IMF for a possible bailout.\n\n“We are so excited that IMF is going to give us close to 3 billion for starters and all that. But if we manage corruption very well, I’m afraid we will not need that money with its attendant problems and conditions. Let’s look at the issue of waste and a lot of information are available within the auditor general’s report year by year. How far have we come, and how far have we learned from them to continue to see these things in our books? It is unfortunate.\n\n“If you look at issue of waste, in terms of projects we pursue. Projects that have little or no benefit for society and then we are in there. We undertake projects without records of stakeholder engagement, and when people raise their voices those projects become abandoned and we adjust to devising such projects. We have seen issues of misapplication of state resources. In the sense that the constitution makes it mandatory for all government that when you inherit power, any project that is done using state money you will continue,” Dr. Asante explained.\n\nHe continued; “But there are buildings today that are languishing in the bush and that we don’t seem to care about it. we forget that state money was put into such resources. Look at the way we execute contracts in this country as if there is no supervisor of contracts that the state has awarded. We do it anyhow and people benefit from that through poor supervision and poor execution of state projects. What is more, is that we see even some is that we see of these contracts ending up in judgement debt.”',

Before I took the decision against this year, I humbly visited him to seek his advice and blessings. He assured me of his blessings for the respect and honour shown him. His continuous blessing and advice is what has propelled us this far. U pledge to continue to seek his wise counsel on this journey,” he stated.\n\nRead the full statement below:',

    "Presidential hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Alan Kyerematen, has described the economic policies pursued over the years by several governments as a 'cul de sac.'\n\nSpeaking on URA Radio in Bolgatanga in the Upper East leg of his nationwide tour, Alan Kyerematen pointed out that the narrow focus of Ghana's continued reliance on cocoa, gold, and a few primary raw material exports, is a cul de sac orientation to economic management, and which has limited growth in the economy. \n\nDoing things the same way over and over returns the same results. \n\nCocoa, for example, has brought in under $2billion per annum into the Ghanaian economy annually over the past decades. \n\nHowever, the President's Special Intitiatives (PSIs), initiated by Alan Kyerematen, comprising four simple local products: salt, oil palm, cassava and garments, could have unleashed a potential combined annual income stream of $60b a year. \n\nHowever, policy distortion and irregular political choices reduced the nations' capacity to grow and benefit from the PSI's. Currently, the ten point strategic growth pillars developed and being implemented under Hon. Kyerematen, during his tenure as Minister for Trade and Industry, has brought in 1D1F, the automotive industry, and others. \n\nSpeaking to the Great Transformational Plan  (GTP), Alan inspires that the country deserves leadership with a big vision. A vision that moves us beyond the cul de sac into strategic growth areas following through on the GTP. \n\nAlan Kyerematen is also primary to the design, establishment and implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which brings together a market of nearly a billion and a half consumers for producers within the diversified economy necessary to expand opportunities for the youth. \n\nOn the same programme, Mr Alan Kyerematen reiterated his desire to modernise the New Patriotic Party (NPP) into a formidable force to better drive public policy and thence enable better mobilisation of communities towards opportunities. Not only will he create a businesslike Party, capable of generating independent financial, technical and human resources but also a big voice into Government appointments, especially at local level. \n\nThe Upper East Region is the tenth region to have been visited by the Alan Kyerematen for President Campaign after Ashanti, Bono East, Bono, Ahafo, Western North, Volta, Eastern, Oti and Northern regions.",

    "The New Patriotic Party (NPP) Member of Parliament (MP) for Mpraeso, Davis Ansah Opoku, has confronted his Majority Chief Whip, Frank-Annoh Dompreh, over his claim that Alan Kyeramanten was the chairman of the Economic Committee of Cabinet. \n\nThe Majority Chief Whip in a tweet shared on Thursday, February 23, 2023, provided ‘evidence’ to back his claim that the New Patriotic Party (NPP) presidential hopeful, Alan Kyerematen, was the head of the Economic Committee of the Cabinet of the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo government.\n\nFrank Annoh-Dompreh, during an interview on Adom TV interview, monitored by GhanaWeb refuted suggestions by supporters of Alan that Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia will not be a good messenger for the NPP for the 2024 elections because he is responsible for the economic hardship in Ghana, as the head of the country’s Economic Management Team.\n\nAnnoh-Dompreh, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Nsawam Adoagyiri said that Alan is equally responsible for Ghana’s economic meltdown because he is the head of the Economic Management Committee of the Cabinet of Ghana.\n\nThe 'evidence' he provided was a portion of a purported document of the Cabinet of Ghana which showed a list of members of the Economic Committee and the Minister for Trade and Industry was the chairperson of the committee.\n\nThe other members of the committee were the Minister for Finance, who was the “Alternate Chairperson” of the committee; the Minister for Food and Agriculture; Minister for Energy; Minister for Employment and Labour Relations; the Minister for Fisheries and Aquaculture Development; Minister for Public Enterprises; the Senior Presidential Advisor and the Presidential Advisor on the Economy.\n\nReacting to this in an interview on Adom FM on Thursday, February 23, 2023, Davis Ansah Opoku said that he is surprised by the actions of the Majority Chief Whip.\n\nHe said every Ghanaian knows that the Economic Management Team, which is set up by the president, is responsible for providing advice on the running of the economy.\n\nHe added that the Economic Committee of Cabinet only presents programmes of the various ministry under it during Cabinet meetings. \n\n“I’m surprised, this thing is being led by Annoh Dompreh and I don’t see that need for it… cabinet has sub-committees according to the sectors of the economy. Because all the ministries cannot bring their programmes to cabinet meetings so these committees collect all the programmes of ministries under them and present them during the meetings.\n\n“But when it comes to the management of the economy, it is the Economic Management Team that has been responsible for it since and nobody should run away from it,”  he said Twi.\n\nHe questioned why the chairperson of the Economic Committee does not address Ghanaians on the economy if s/he is indeed superior to the head of the Economic Management Team, who is required to do so.\n\nWatch the interview below:\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also watch this episode of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV below:\n\n\n\nIB/OGB",

This is an internal election… All the people who have expressed interest in contesting in the primaries are eminently qualified and they have all worked for the New Patriotic Party.\n\n“But when I look at the entirety of the eminent personals, I think that His Excellence the Vice President stands tall, no matter how you look at it – his competencies, his track record, his personality (how he relates with people), the digitalisation agenda that he is driving to transform the face of our economy,” he said in Twi.\n\nThe Deputy Minister for Energy, who is also the Member of Parliament for Sekondi, described Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, as a machine who together with Bawumia will transform Ghana.\n\n“It is my prayer that if by God’s grace, Dr Bawumia becomes our flagbearer, his running mate will be Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh. Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh is a machine and we need a machine to deliver,” he said.\n\nThe MP also said that he is confident that the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo government will turn things after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout it is seeking is completed.\n\nThe likes of the former Trade and Industry Minister Alan Kyerematen Assin, Central MP Ken Agyapong, Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, the former Food and Agriculture Minister, Dr. Owusu Afriyie Akoto, ex-Mampong MP Francis Addai-Nimoh and Regional Cooperation Minister Dr Kofi Konadu Apreku, are expected to face off in the race for the flagbearership position of the NPP.\n\nWatch the interview below:\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also watch this episode of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV below:\n\n\n\nIB/OGB",
    'The spokesperson of Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, Dr. Gideon Boako, has revealed that any of the candidates contesting for the New Patriotic Party’s (NPP) flagbearership who gets the support of five incumbent Members of Parliament(MP) in the Ashanti region will win the election.\n\nHe was also quick to shoot down claims from pro-Alan elements that Dr. Bawumia as flagbearer will reduce the votes of the party in the Ashanti Region; arguing that the Vice President has over the years endeared to the people of the Ashanti Region even more than candidates from the region.\n\nDr. Gideon Boako was speaking on Wontumi Radio when he made this known.\n\n“The Ashantis are not looking for people who will just say I can trace my roots there or they come from that place. They are looking for someone who will relate well with them and not have the boss, subordinate relationship.\n\nYou can be from there but you are not humble enough to have time for the party members. They see Bawumia and he is like a son to the Ashantis. He endears so much to the party and they know him very well. He comes for funerals and joins most social gatherings in the region. During campaigns, he’s the one they see. You can say you are from the Ashanti Region but have the people seen you campaigning for the party in the region before?"\n\nIf you want a position in the NPP and you tell the people from Ashanti Region that they have to vote for you, what the NPP members in the Ashanti Region will ask you is when was the last time you came to Bosome Freho or Ejura to campaign. They can say that Bawumia who you claim is not from Ashanti Region 2020, 2016 campaign we were with him in the Ashanti Region.\n\nThe Ashanti party is closer to Bawumia than anything. This is right from the grassroots. When we come to the Ashanti Region, you’ll get lots of the chairmen, and constituency chairmen following Vice President.\n\nOut of the number of MPs in the Ashanti Region, if any candidate apart from Bawumia is able to get more than five MPs supporting them, I will say they will win the election. Bawumia will have the support. Bawumia will get not less than 80% of the Ashanti MPs supporting him. When some persons who said they are from the Ashanti Region went back home, they had only two MPs behind them. But when Bawumia is in the Ashanti Region, he has full support from the grassroots upwards. This is an indication of who the people want. Per what I’ve seen, there’s no candidate who can command even 30% of the Ashanti Region votes apart from Bawumia,” he said.',

    "The Deputy Spokesperson for Alan Kyerematen, Richard Nyamah, has claimed that it is because a powerful person within the New Patriotic Party (NPP) heavily invested in the campaign of the sitting Member of Parliament for Adenta, Mohammed Adamu Ramadan, that he won the seat. \n\nIt is worth noting that the current MP is a member of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), but is also the sister of the wife of the vice president, Samira Bawumia. \n\nAccording to Richard Nyamah, the only reason Yaw Buaben Asamoa, a one-time MP for the Adentan constituency was unable to retain that seat is because of the contributions of this powerful person, who he described as Annoh-Dompreh's preferred choice.  \n\nHe said this while reacting to an earlier interview of the Majority Chief Whip in Parliament, Frank Annoh-Dompreh, on Adom TV, where the legislator dared Buaben Asamoa to win back the Adenta seat which has, for many years, been a New Patriotic Party (NPP) seat. \n\n“The Hon MP further went ahead to malign Hon Yaw Buaben Asamoa, former MP for Adentan and former Director of NPP Party Communications, now Spokesperson and Director of Communications for the Alan Kyerematen Campaign, by casting untrue aspersions on his person and character and then cheekily damning him to dare to win back the Adentan Parliamentary Seat, lost to the Party in the 2020 General elections. The real question is why and how the seat was lost. \n\n“If the Hon Annoh-Dompreh is not familiar with the story of how his preferred candidate for leadership of the NPP reportedly helped invest heavily in his brother-in-law to gift an NPP held seat to our main opponents, then he is indeed doing the High Office of Chief Whip an injustice. \n\n“It is the business of the Chief Whip to have his finger on the pulse of the Party but his aspersions in respect of Adentan Constituency show that either he is not on top of his game or that he has deliberately blinded himself to further the interests of his preferred candidate, even if the parliamentary preferences of his candidate have been hurtful to the fortunes of the NPP.  Now the question that begs answering is, will Annoh-Dompreh be singing praises to his preferred candidate if he was destooled by his brother-in-law from the NDC with the tacit support of the Vice President of the land?” he wrote. \n\nRichard Nyamah also refuted claims by the MP that Alan Kyerematen was in charge of an Economic Management Committee. \n\nHe indicated that there is no such committee and that if there is, then Frank Annoh-Dompreh should produce its members, as well as its mandate. \n\nMeanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:\n\n\n\n\n\nAE/OGB",

    'Director of Communications for the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP), Richard Ahiagbah has stated that the Akufo-Addo government is on course to restore the country’s economic stability and growth that existed before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAddressing the press at the party headquarters in Aslym Down, Accra, today Wednesday 22 February 2023, Richard Ahiagbah, said the government’s Post Covid-19 Program for Economic Growth (PC-PEG) is a solid blueprint that is ushering the country out of the economic setback the people of Ghana have had to endure the last 12months.\n\nNDC’s poor record\n\nBefore he outlined the recovery plans of the Akufo-Addo administration, Mr. Ahiagbah, took a swipe at the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) for what he says is a deliberate effort on the part of the opposition party to “misled many Ghanaians to think that [the Akufo-Addo government] has mismanaged the economy since assuming office”.\n\n“This claim by the NDC however is not supported by the hard economic data and the reality around the world. In all these, the NDC has not provided any credible alternative solution(s). They are talking a lot but not about solutions.  It is blame, mischaracterization, and denial of obvious global economic realities” Richard Ahiagbah said. \n\nSupporting his argument on the “poor performance” of the NDC when they were in office between 2013 and 2016, Ahiagbah said, “on the larger economy which is measured in terms of GDP the NDC, supervised a perpetual decline from 2013 to 2016”.\n\n“In 2013, GDP was 7.3%; in 2014 it was 4%; in 2015 it was 3.9% and in 2016 it was 3.7%. In terms of percentage changes in the GPD, the economy deteriorated by 45.2% in 2014 compared to 2013 growth. Similarly, the economy decreased by 2.5% in 2015 and 5.12% in 2016.\n\n“In the Real Sector, which includes Agriculture, Industry, and Service, the NDC’s performance was even worst. From 2013, real sector growth plummeted significantly across all sectors. In 2014 all the sectors grew at a negative rate using 2013 performance as a base” Mr. Ahiagbah said.\n\n“Let me remind you that this poor performance was against the NDC inheriting an economy that had discovered oil in commercial quantities and began production in 2010; which shot Ghana’s GDP to 14% in 2011.  All that growth momentum was vanquished by the NDC, led by Ex-President Mahama” he added. \n\nNPP’s outstanding performance\n\nComparing the NDC’s performance with the NPP’s time in office before the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the NPP’s director of communications noted that available data shows that the “NPP turned around the contracting economy it inherited from the NDC in 2017 to date”.\n\n“On GDP, 2017 GDP grew at 8.1 percent compared to 3.7 percent in 2016, 2018 GDP grew by 6.3%, 2019 GDP grew by 6.5% and 2020 GDP grew by 0.5%. In the real rector, the industry recorded its highest growth of 16.7% in 2017, with Agriculture at 8.4%, and the Services sectors at 4.3%.\n\n“Industry grew from a mournful negative 0.5% in 2016 to 16.7 percent in 2017 and Services grew from 2.8% in 2016 to an appreciable 4.3% in 2017,” Ahiagbah said.\n\n“The Agric sector also grew from a dismal 2.7% in 2016 to 8.4% in 2017. Friends from the media, this data we just reviewed imply that the vulnerable in our society, the poor, indeed, the vast majority of Ghanaians fared much better under NPP in 2017. Data is sacred” he added.\n\nRecovery plan\n\nAs part of the recovery plan, Mr. Ahiagbah said “Government has introduced the Post Covid-19 Program for Economic Growth (PC-PEG) to among others establish a sustainable macro-fiscal path, restore debt sustainability and macro-economic stability underpinned by key structural reform and social protection”.\n\nAccording to Richard Ahiagbah, “the PC-PEG will address the economic challenges of this country through fiscal consolidation, get treatment, and structural reform” and that “Government through the Central Bank has responded with a raft of monetary policy measures, including the bi-weekly FX forward auction, and the BDC forex auction which has helped subdue the pressure on the spot FX market”.\n\n“To complement the monetary policies which have been activated, the Government has subsequently announced Expenditure-led measures including a 30% cut in discretionary expenditures, a moratorium on the new creation of government units, a freeze on government travels, 30 percent cut in salaries of the executive and political appointees, among others,” Ahiagbah said.\n\n“Other policies such as the implementation of the Gold for Oil (G4O) program, implementation of the COVID-19 Alleviation & Revitalization of Enterprises Support (CARES) Program, to inject some Ghc100 billion into the economy” [are all part of the larger strategy of the government to the country’s economic stability] Ahiagbah added.\n\n“Government’s transformative agenda to digitalize the economy [which is aimed at formalizing] the Ghanaian economy & improve its administrative systems & global competitiveness, the banking sector reforms which has introduced a tighter regulatory & supervisory framework in the sector are all part of the steps government is taking to revive the economy.\n\n“Through these innovative measures, the government is demonstrating its resolve to build back the economy quickly and restore fiscal rectitude. Government’s commitment to these measures is a clear assurance that we are on the right track and capable of causing a turnaround of the economy with the resolute support of all Ghanaians” Richard Ahiagbah further stated.\n\nWay Forward for Economy\n\nIn his press statement, the NPP\'s director of communications identified several thematic areas that the government is paying attention to tackle the prevailing economic challenges.\n\nMr. Ahiagbah noted that in 2022, the government introduced a raft of fiscal and monetary measures to rein in expenditures and improve revenue mobilization, including a cut in discretionary spending, a cut in the salaries of the executives, a freeze on foreign travel, among others".\n\n"The 2023 budget indicates the government’s desire to continue fiscal consolidation efforts and reduce the fiscal deficit in line with the pending IMF Programme. The government expects to record one of the lowest deficits this year, much lower than the GH¢64.0 billion announced in the 2023 budget" Ahiagbah said.\n\n"Expenditure measures, the debt treatment program, and structural reforms, among others, are all measures that the Akufo-Addo administration has embarked on to ensure that the economy is stabilized and subsequently made to grow as was the case before the COVID-19 pandemic" Ahiagbah added.',

    'The General Secretary of the Convention People’s Party (CPP), Nana Yaa Jantuah has hit hard at the NPP government for keeping Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta, in office months after the country’s economy deteriorated.\n\nThe former Public Affairs Director for the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) who was speaking on Power FM’s Inside Politics programme wondered why the minister was still in office after Ghana borrowed so hugely in a debt distress level.\n\n“Ken Ofori-Atta abon [Ken Ofori-Atta is incompetent],” she said in Akan while explaining that the finance minister is highly incompetent and unintelligent for allowing the economy to slowly grind to a halt amid warnings from experts.\n\n“When I call them F9 (unintelligent) ministers people want to come after me but that is who they are: non-performing ministers,” she argued.\n\nYaa Jantuah said times are hard that the working class and the ordinary people cannot afford a 3 square meal which was possible before the NPP took over power in 2017.\n\nThe hardship, she explained, was as a result of the inflationary spiral fuelled by a steep depreciation of the cedi which was not managed for a long time.\n\nTo her, President Akufo-Addo should have sacked Ofori-Atta long before the economy got crushed to a point that the country cannot pay for its domestic and external debts.\n\nExperts and rating agents have described Ghana’s economy as one that is in a huge debt crisis.\n\nFinding a way to handle the government’s debts internationally, Finance Minister Ofori-Atta recently disclosed that the government has initiated talks with China over Ghana’s debt following a successful Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP).\n\nHe told Citi News that negotiations with China are important because China holds the majority of the external bonds, stressing that he was to lead a delegation to China to plead for debt cancellation.\n\n“The big elephant in the room is China, we will be visiting China by the end of the week to really discuss how they come into the envelope as quickly as possible. So we are looking at that support from them. China represents about a third of the $5.7 billion loan and so it is important that we engage them,” he said.\n\nNana Yaa Jantuah believes Ghana should not have degraded to a level that a team that mocked the previous government for going for an IMF bailout will now be drowned in debt borne out of mismanagement.\n\nHe partly blamed the nepotistic nature of President Akufo-Addo who is related to Ofori-Atta for the economic mess which she said had plunged the country into hunger.',

Elections are won by your character, by your good self – endearing yourself to the electorates, articulating your vision and they having the acceptability for you that you could be, and you are qualified to be their leader; not necessarily any name as such,” he explained. \n\nSpeaking with GhanaWeb TV’s Etsey Atisu in an interview on Election Desk, Francis Addai-Nimoh recalled how, for instance, he out-performed many more experienced names in the party during the 2014 presidential primaries of the NPP. \n\nHe said that because of the confidence the delegates have in him, he came out third in that race, even though he was regarded as the underdog in the race. \n\n“Similarly, in 2014, when the seven contestants, and I was one of them, I was seen to be the underdog; I was seen to be someone unknown in the political environment of our country. The other six contestants had all worked under J. A. Kufuor’s administration either as ministers of state, or deputy ministers of state, and Addai-Nimoh had not been in that position before. \n\n“But when we went through that process in 2014, I came in third, which was an enviable position that I secured for myself, and that shows the potential that the NPP delegates found in me and then encouraged me to make progress with this ambition,” he added. \n\nThe former Member of Parliament for Mampong also shared some other reasons why he is vying for the flagbearer position of the NPP again. \n\nWatch more below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAE/OGB',

    'Aspiring flagbearer of the NPP, Ing. Francis Addai-Nimoh, has advised Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta that transparency is key to winning the hearts of Ghanaians as the country continues to grapple with a debt crisis.\n\nIn an interview with Don Kwabena Prah on Happy 98.9 FM’s “Epa Hoa Daben” socio-political talk show, the former Member of Parliament called on Ken Ofori-Atta, to provide data to support the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP), which requires pensioners and other bondholders to contribute to resolving Ghana’s debt crisis.\n\nIng. Addai-Nimoh urged the Finance Minister to compare the number of pensioners who have government bonds and the quantum of their investment with the investments of other financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies.\n\n“At the beginning, my position on the issue was for the Finance Minister to provide the number of pensioners who have government bonds. Then the quantum of their investment. It was later that I realized the investment was around 2.2b. So compare that figure with the others, the banks, the insurance companies, and others. Then ask what the effect will be if the pensioners are exempted or added. “For me, it was just simple,” he said.\n\nHowever, Ing. Addai-Nimoh stressed the importance of transparency in the decision-making process, saying that the Finance Minister needs to provide the public with the necessary information so they can make informed decisions and trust\n\nIng. Addai-Nimoh believes that if the Finance Minister can provide the public with the necessary information, Ghanaians will be more willing to support efforts to address the country’s debt crisis. Ultimately, transparency will be key to winning the hearts of Ghanaians, according to the aspiring flagbearer of the NPP.\n\n“When he said we needed to help him for him to help us, that was a good statement. But then submit the spare sheets with the figures, bring them to the public so that we can understand why pensioners are in there, and with that, we can determine where the effects are insignificant or not. “Without it, they can’t trust you,” he said.\n\n“They have been exempted, and it’s refreshing to know, but we shouldn’t have dragged this issue to where we go.” The figures should have been provided so we know how much the financial institutions and their investments in government bonds total. So, if we decide to exempt pensioners and the consequences are minimal and we can still manage the debt situation, why not exempt them? “”Since they’ve been exempted, I’d commend them for standing their ground and expressing their displeasure,” he added.',

    'A former executive of the Tema East constituency branch of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), Stephen Ashitey Adjei, has accused former President Mahama of using empty promises of juicy appointments to deceive gurus of the party.\n\nIn the latest of his writings on happenings in the party, Mr. Ashitey Adjei, who is popularly called Moshake, accused the former President of secretly enticing some leading figures of the party with ministerial appointments to win them over.\n\n“It is not only Ministerial appointments, even the running mate position, Mr. Mahama is playing lotto with it by promising multiple people that he will make them running Mate,” Moshake wrote.\n\nThe accusation is the latest by Moshake who has been rubbing Mr. Mahama’s nose into his past mistakes which he says led to the NDC losing power twice in 2016 and 2020.\n\nHis write-up which is one in a series that he has been putting out since 2020 comes as the NDC slowly builds up toward a congress to elect its flagbearer for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nLike all other salvos that Moshake has released, this one is bound to rub Mr. Mahama sore because of the facts that Moshake characteristically laces with his punches.\n\nand the write-up is coming at a time that many in the NDC are tired of the Mahama brand and are looking for a fresh face to lead the NDC which has been under the Mahama influence since 2012.\n\nThe former constituency executive accuses Mr. Mahama of, “promising positions like confetti to NDC gurus just to win their favour for the upcoming presidential primary.”\n\nHowever, he vows that, “no empty promise will yield the loyalties of anybody because every single person in the NDC knows how neglectful John Mahama is. We remember how Mahama snubbed NDC members and appointed strangers like Raymond Atuguba, Nayong Billy Joe Alhassan Azong and others when he became president.”\n\nHe called on, “all the executives that Mahama has promised the positions to reject his indecent proposal out of hand to show him he John Mahama cannot deceive any NDC guru with the promise of position.”\n\nMeanwhile, Moshake has urged the party’s delegates to, “get with the wind of change and vote massively for Dr. Kwabena Duffuor to lead the party in 2024.”',

    'Member of Parliament for Dome Kwabenya, Sarah Adwoa Safo has made her first appearance in parliament since the House resumed sitting on February 7, 2023.\n\n The third session of the eighth Parliament resumed on February 7, 2023, after the house went on break for Christmas and new festivities.\n\n Following the resumption of the house, Adwoa Safo did not make any appearance in the chamber even though she was in the country.\n\n Adwoa Safo’s absence from parliament was one of the most discussed topics in the country in 2022. The discussion came on the back of her leaving the country after the 2022 budget was passed on November 26, 2021.\n\n However, on November 11 2022, Adwoa Safo officially resumed her parliamentary duties following her return from the United States of America.\n\n Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, on October 26, 2022, ruled that the report of the committee set up to look into her case and that of two other MPs who absented themselves for a number of sittings should be presented before the whole house for a debate.\n\n Alban Bagbin dismissed the objection of the Majority Leader, Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu, to the admissibility of the committee report for the consideration of the house.\n\n “As I have noted in this ruling, the decision (sic) on not to admit a motion is the exclusive preserve of the Speaker.

    'The Campaign Team of Mr Alan Kyerematen, a flagbearer hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) has urged the Party to hold its presidential primaries early to offer the prospective leader adequate time to prepare for the 2024 general election. \n\nThe Team has also appealed to the Party’s leadership to allow aspirants to campaign ahead of the date for the primaries to offer them enough time to engage with delegates. \n\nIn an interview with the Ghana News Agency, Mr Yaw Buaben Asamoa, Spokesperson for Mr Kyerematen’s Campaign, said the Camp would prefer the presidential primaries to be held in either August or September this year. \n\n“We believe that the earlier the date, the better. If we are to succeed ourselves as an administration, then it is important that we have the next potential President early so that the President can influence public policy going forward,” he said. \n\nMr Asamoa said if elected earlier, the flagbearer would have the opportunity to make input in the priorities and budgets of the Government in a manner that would positively affect the chances of the Party in the next general election. \n\nHe said the Party’s delegates also needed enough time to meet with the aspirants and assess their capabilities, hence the need for the Party to allow the aspirants to campaign ahead of their nomination. \n\n“If the nomination process is delaying because the Party cannot fix the date for the election, then it is difficult for the candidate and the Party itself because that space could be filled with activity between delegates and potential candidates,” Mr Asamoa said. \n\nThe NPP is yet to announce a date for its presidential and parliamentary primaries. \n\nThe Party’s National Council met in Accra earlier this month to decide on the date for the primaries, but the meeting was reported to have ended inconclusively. \n\nThe Party said it would engage broadly on the issue to arrive at a consensus. \n\nPer the NPP’s Constitution, the Party must elect its presidential candidate 11 months before the general election, when it is in power. \n\nMr Kyerematen, who has been working towards becoming President since 207, resigned as Minister of Trade and Industry last month to pursue his presidential ambition. \n\nHe officially announced his decision to contest the NPP flagbearership race in an address on January 10, 2023. \n\nIn that address, Mr Kyerematen said the country required a new plan to build a self-reliant economy to avoid going back to the International Monetary Fund in future. \n\nHe said if he succeeded in his quest to become President in the next general election, he would launch and lead the execution of the Great Transformational Plan of Ghana, which would span the period 2025 to 2030 to revamp key sectors of the economy. \n\nMr Asamoa said Mr Kyerematen had so far toured the Ashanti, Bono East, Bono, Ahafo, Western North, Volta, and Eastern regions, where he met chiefs and delegates to officially inform them about his decision to contest the NPP flagbearership race. \n\n“Everywhere we have been, there is the feeling that Mr Kyerematen is the right man in the right place for the right job,” he said.',
    'Mr. Gabriel Kwamigah-Atokple Tanko, a businessperson and National Welfare Committee member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), is lacing his boots to make a second attempt at the Parliamentary primaries of the party in the Ketu North Constituency. \n\nHe contested the primaries in 2019 but lost to incumbent Dr James Klutse Avedzi. \n\nThe aspirant, who has been touring the various branches of the NDC in the constituency ahead of the party’s Presidential and Parliamentary primaries slated for May, this year, made his intentions known in an interview with the Ghana News Agency at Dzodze. \n\nAccording to the business executive and professional who has served in various capacities in the NDC both in the Ketu North Constituency and at the national level and a member of the Volta and Ketu North Finance Committees of the party, he was compelled by the dream to usher in a new dawn for the NDC in Ketu North. \n\nThe hopeful as affectionately called Tanko as he is affectionately believes there can be no better replacement for the incumbent Member of Parliament (MP) Dr. James Klutse Avedzi who has hinted of his decision not to run for the position again, than him (Tanko).  \n\n“My passion and effort to contribute to the development of our constituency is paramount- the evidence can be seen across the Constituency since my civil service days- I am ready and prepared for the job like no other,” he said. \n\nMr Tanko, who is sure of winning the Ketu North NDC parliamentary primaries, intends to unite the party when he wins the constituency and national election.\n\nThe seat is being eyed by Edem Agbana, the immediate past deputy National Communications officer of the party.  \n\nHe advised all parliamentary primary hopefuls against a campaign of insults, attacks, and acrimony, which sometimes characterised political competitions and called for a change of the status quo. \n\n“It’s imperative that we avoid politics of insults and attacks on one another and rather focus on the messages we have as aspirants for the Branch Executives in the interest of peace and harmony going forward,” he advised. \n\nMr Tanko said his tour of the constituency affirms his commitment of prosecuting an issue-based campaign devoid of character assassinations, and all other unhealthy discourses that may frustrate intended reconciliation activities after the elections in the Ketu North constituency. \n\n“The gate of my house remains open to all NDC faithful, who truly seek the progress of our beloved constituency,” Tanko added as he campaigns on a message of  “New Dawn” (NUBUKƐ).',

We are seeking to win a third consecutive general election. We are seeking to break the eight that has so far eluded the two major political parties in the fourth republic.\n\n“Obviously, to achieve this extraordinary and unprecedented feat, we need to do the extraordinary. We cannot do the same things we’ve been doing from 1992 and expect to achieve a different result, more so, when the result in question, is one that no political party in Ghana has been able to achieve. This consciousness is what I expect to drive our 2024 project. We must all be conscious of the enormity of the task ahead of us to be able to work our hearts out towards its realization,” Chairman Ntim said while addressing a Retreat by the Council of Elders of the Greater Accra Region branch of the party at Peduase in Aburi.\n\nHe added that the target of the current national executives is to ensure victory for the NPP come 2024 and nothing will stop them from achieving this objective.\n\n“Consistent with our mandate, we, as national officers, following our election in July 2022, set for ourselves, a target of working assiduously to retain power in 2024 to justify the confidence that had been reposed in us by the party’s delegates. This particular commitment to delivering nothing but victory to the party come 2024, has, at all times, been our primary focus in everything we do.”',
    "Ohemaa Borngreat, a member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) communication team, has berated President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo’s administration over its misuse of funds it mobilized to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShe claimed in an interview with TV XYZ that the administration completely misappropriated over 20 billion (cedis) which is equivalent to one million five hundred ninety thousand four hundred fifty-seven dollars monies raised to combat the Covid-19 outbreak and is now seeking just 3 billion dollars from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by way of the financial bailout. which her claim is false. \n\nShe made these remarks while reacting to the government’s decision to include certain individuals in its domestic debt exchange programme. \n\n“By God’s grace, Covid is not a blessing but it is a blessing in disguise because when Covid came Ghanaians had a lot of benefits from the Covid. \n\n“So, if you’re a prudent government, couldn't you have invested the Covid money and we wouldn’t have even been here chasing the IMF for just 3 billion. \n“Whereby you had over 21 billion from the Covid fund. What did you do with the money? The Ministry of Information paid over 1.51 billion old cedis to themselves as risk allowance. So, the government has no vision for us,” she said. \n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, has calmed the nerves of pensioner bondholders, insisting that the government will not shortchange their legitimate rights but will honour their coupon payments and maturing principals, like all government bondholders.\n\nHe told Parliament that the government remained committed to the well-being and dignity of the senior citizens and pensioners.\n\nOn the other hand, President Akufo-Addo has also stated that the government’s debt exchange programme (DEP) was fraught with several challenges after its announcement, but it has largely been accepted by the citizenry.\n\nHe made this known when the German Federal Minister of Finance, Christian Lindner, paid him a visit at the Jubilee House. \n\nThe government has also announced 85% subscription rate for the DDEP which faced stiff challenges from a range of bondholders.\n\n\n\nAM/SARA",

He has no Godfather, that’s all. So they do all those evil and call it Mafia. And somebody speak out with joy to say we have played him mafia.” Mr Kwadwo Nuamah told Kwame Tanko on Angel FM Kumasi in an interview monitored by MyNewsGH.com.\n\nHe further revealed that, the source of such power struggle in the party is mostly the fight between an MP and CEO of a government agency.\n\n“The issue of fight between CEO and MPs is very brutal, and it brings some kind of hatred to you. A typical example is myself. I was in the UK, sold my house, came down and did campaign. I had a 90% win in the constituency which is unprecedented, that after elections, every 9 people out of 10 will vote for you, it has never happened. The party should have even contacted me and learn how I was able to do that”, Mr Kwadwo Nuamah narrated.\n\nThe former lawmaker indicated that in most cases, people who are engaged in such mafia style do not build proper relationship with the party people at the grassroots.\n\nIn the 2016 Parliamentary election in Kwadaso Constituency in the Ashanti Region, Hon Samiu Kwadwo Nuamah polled 61,631 representing 90.0% while the NDC candidate Monica Bawuah had 6,263 representing 9.2% of the total votes cast.\n\nIn 2004 NPP candidate had, 83.2 with NDC 13.6, 2008 NPP polled 82.7% NDC 15.3%, whiles in 2012 the NPP Had 83.6% and polling NDC 14.5%.\n\nMr Kwadwo Nuamah was succeeded by incumbent MP for the constituency Dr. Kingsley Nyarko in 2020.',

The MPs believe that Dr. Bawumia is the best bet to lead the party, and I have no doubt in my mind that he will emerge victorious,” he said.\n\nThe Sefwi Akontombra MP dropped a hint that all the MPs canvassing support for the Vice President will soon come forward to unveil the cloak of anonymity for the public to know and recognise them.\n\n\n“We’ll be addressing a press conference to declare our support as MPs for the Vice President very soon. Dr. Bawumia is a Vice President who has shown majority and capability that he is the only person who can lead the NPP to break the eight,” he disclosed.\n\nTouching on the delegates, Mr. Djornobuah mentioned that about 80 per cent of the delegates would vote for the Vice President.\n\n“I know and believe that Western North, we’ll not disappoint the Vice President because it is time for us to reciprocate what he has done for us. And if we want more of such development then we need to vote for the Vice President,” he added.\n\nThe lawmaker pointed out that Dr. Bawumia is the right person to battle former President John Dramani Mahama in the Northern regions, adding that “with the support of our strongholds in Ashanti, Eastern and other regions, we can break the eight.”\n\nHe mentioned that the ruling NPP government has done marvelously well considering the challenges confronting nations across the world as a result of COVID-19 pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, yet the government is still embarking on infrastructure development, sustaining social intervention programmes such as Free Senior High School (FSHS), One District One Factory (1D1F) among others without Ghanaians experiencing power crisis unlike under the previous National Democratic Congress (NDC).\n\nHe, however, admitted that the NPP has made some mistakes in terms of governance, but was quick to add that Ghanaians are safer under NPP than NDC in terms of hardship.',

    'Former executive of the Tema East constituency branch of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), Mr. Stephen Ashitey Adjei, has opined that John Mahama as a flagbearer will be good news for the NPP. \n\nAccording to him, the NPP knows how to damage the Mahama brand and that having him in the saddle will be inimical to the chances of the NDC. \n\nAccording to him, “the agenda is nothing new, but in the same cast as the old plot to make Mr. Mahama, with all of his baggage of past scandals, become flagbearer again so that the NPP can have an easy campaign,” he wrote.\n\nThe NPP government has failed miserably and will be going into the 2024 election campaigns as underdogs. However, if they were to have somebody like Mr. Mahama as the NDC’s flagbearer, then the NPP would simply arch back and repeat their successful campaigns in 2016 and 2020, in which Mahama was framed as the most incompetent man to have governed the country, again.\n\nMany people in the party, including Moshake, have been fighting to ensure this dirty old trick of the NPP does not repeat successfully in 2024.\n\n“In 2020, we were here when the NPP’s Ashanti regional Chairman, Bernard Antwi Boasiako, alias Wontumi, revealed that Mahama had been ordered to contest as flagbeaerer so that the NPP can easily beat him.\n\n“Similarly, we were here when the Tema West constituency Chairman of the NPP at the time, Dennis Amfo-Sefah, alias Nana Boakye, also ordered Mahama to run and when he did we lost by over 500,000 votes,” Moshake wrote.\n\nHe added, “they are trying to repeat the same trick and Mahama has agreed to be the point man again. However, our promise is that we will resist this with everything we have because 2024 is not only about the fate of the NDC, but a mission to rescue Ghana.”\n\nHe called on NDC delegates to, “frustrate the NPP plan by massively voting to elect Dr, Kwabena Duffuor\xa0as\xa0flagbearer.”',
