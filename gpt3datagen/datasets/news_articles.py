    'The Ministry of Energy has said Frances Essiam’s attack on the Minister, Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh is a misdirection of anger.\n\nFrances Essiam speaking on her sack from the Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing company as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) blamed Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh for her woes.\n\nShe said the minister had challenges with a state agency that had opted to support the Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing company in its drive to expand but Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh had his own plans and therefore will not agree to her agreements reached with a state agency of her choice.\n\n"...with all our hard work and efforts at the company, there are some who don’t want us to be successful...so I’ve decided to resign. I’m a woman of substance, a woman of peace and highly knowledgeable... I have resigned so Dr. Mathew Opoku Prempeh, Minister for Energy and Manhyia South MP can now have his way; he can do whatever he wants with Ghana Cylinder Manufacturing Company; he can grind and chew it ... I have not heard from the President but I am resigning in principle... he (Mathew Opoku Prempeh) should bring it on, I am ready for him,” she said. \n\nBut a Communications Specialist at the Ministry of Energy, Kofi Abrefa Afena has disclosed Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh neither appointed nor fired Madam Frances as she claimed.\n\nHe indicated the rants of Frances Asiam “Is a clear case of misdirected anger and he will not be dragged into that hullabaloo. I believe Madam Frances can pick up any challenges she has with the termination of her appointment with the appointing authority”.\n\nArguing that since Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh took over as Energy Minister, he has “supported and guided the agency heads to the best of his ability and he will continue to do so, for the good of Mother Ghana”.',

Our statements and behaviour should motivate people . . . if you are a Minister, you have to be sensitive to the Ghanaian people," he advised.\n\nHe urged the delegates to engage in a lifestyle audit whenever an aspirant offers them money in exchange for votes.\n\n"Sometimes, even the party people should be asking how they are getting those monies," he said.\n\nMr. Kwabena Agyei Agyepong also admonished his colleague aspirants to discourage vote-buying stressing "politics is not a job but a calling", hence seeking to be elected should be an act of service to the people.',
    "A senior lecturer at the University Ghana Political Science Department, Dr. Kwame Asah Asante has said that the country will be able to forgo the IMF bailout and its conditions if the government manages corruption well.\n\nGhana officially contacted the International Monetary Fund to seek financial support. The external creditors provided Ghana with a certain criterion the country must meet to secure a possible $3 billion bailout.\n\nThe government introduced the Domestic Debt Exchange Program (DDEP) to restructure debt as part of the steps to reach board-level approval with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a $3 billion facility to restore macroeconomic stability in the country.\n\nThe government targeted 80% participation in the program to help restructure 137.3 billion Ghana cedis in bonds on the domestic market to bring its total debt, which stands at about 575.5 billion Ghana cedis to sustainable levels.\n\nSpeaking on Morning Starr the Political Scientist said that the government’s mismanagement of corruption is the reason we need to accept all these conditionalities from IMF for a possible bailout.\n\n“We are so excited that IMF is going to give us close to 3 billion for starters and all that. But if we manage corruption very well, I’m afraid we will not need that money with its attendant problems and conditions. Let’s look at the issue of waste and a lot of information are available within the auditor general’s report year by year. How far have we come, and how far have we learned from them to continue to see these things in our books? It is unfortunate.\n\n“If you look at issue of waste, in terms of projects we pursue. Projects that have little or no benefit for society and then we are in there. We undertake projects without records of stakeholder engagement, and when people raise their voices those projects become abandoned and we adjust to devising such projects. We have seen issues of misapplication of state resources. In the sense that the constitution makes it mandatory for all government that when you inherit power, any project that is done using state money you will continue,” Dr. Asante explained.\n\nHe continued; “But there are buildings today that are languishing in the bush and that we don’t seem to care about it. we forget that state money was put into such resources. Look at the way we execute contracts in this country as if there is no supervisor of contracts that the state has awarded. We do it anyhow and people benefit from that through poor supervision and poor execution of state projects. What is more, is that we see even some is that we see of these contracts ending up in judgement debt.”",

It is evident that there is none that understands and appreciates the workings of our party than I do,” he stated.\n\nMr Asare noted that his journey towards parliament had been long in wait as he had to step down from the party’s primaries some four years ago in the interest of the NDC.\n\n“Exactly four years ago, I had to sacrifice my ambition for the greater good of the great NDC by stepping aside for Honourable Paul Evans Aidoo, a man I have immense respect and admiration for. Before I took the decision against this year, I humbly visited him to seek his advice and blessings. He assured me of his blessings for the respect and honour shown him. His continuous blessing and advice is what has propelled us this far. U pledge to continue to seek his wise counsel on this journey,” he stated.\n\nRead the full statement below:",

    "Presidential hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Alan Kyerematen, has described the economic policies pursued over the years by several governments as a 'cul de sac.'\n\nSpeaking on URA Radio in Bolgatanga in the Upper East leg of his nationwide tour, Alan Kyerematen pointed out that the narrow focus of Ghana's continued reliance on cocoa, gold, and a few primary raw material exports, is a cul de sac orientation to economic management, and which has limited growth in the economy. \n\nDoing things the same way over and over returns the same results. \n\nCocoa, for example, has brought in under $2billion per annum into the Ghanaian economy annually over the past decades. \n\nHowever, the President's Special Intitiatives (PSIs), initiated by Alan Kyerematen, comprising four simple local products: salt, oil palm, cassava and garments, could have unleashed a potential combined annual income stream of $60b a year. \n\nHowever, policy distortion and irregular political choices reduced the nations' capacity to grow and benefit from the PSI's. Currently, the ten point strategic growth pillars developed and being implemented under Hon. Kyerematen, during his tenure as Minister for Trade and Industry, has brought in 1D1F, the automotive industry, and others. \n\nSpeaking to the Great Transformational Plan  (GTP), Alan inspires that the country deserves leadership with a big vision. A vision that moves us beyond the cul de sac into strategic growth areas following through on the GTP. \n\nAlan Kyerematen is also primary to the design, establishment and implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which brings together a market of nearly a billion and a half consumers for producers within the diversified economy necessary to expand opportunities for the youth. \n\nOn the same programme, Mr Alan Kyerematen reiterated his desire to modernise the New Patriotic Party (NPP) into a formidable force to better drive public policy and thence enable better mobilisation of communities towards opportunities. Not only will he create a businesslike Party, capable of generating independent financial, technical and human resources but also a big voice into Government appointments, especially at local level. \n\nThe Upper East Region is the tenth region to have been visited by the Alan Kyerematen for President Campaign after Ashanti, Bono East, Bono, Ahafo, Western North, Volta, Eastern, Oti and Northern regions.",

    "The New Patriotic Party (NPP) Member of Parliament (MP) for Mpraeso, Davis Ansah Opoku, has confronted his Majority Chief Whip, Frank-Annoh Dompreh, over his claim that Alan Kyeramanten was the chairman of the Economic Committee of Cabinet. \n\nThe Majority Chief Whip in a tweet shared on Thursday, February 23, 2023, provided ‘evidence’ to back his claim that the New Patriotic Party (NPP) presidential hopeful, Alan Kyerematen, was the head of the Economic Committee of the Cabinet of the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo government.\n\nFrank Annoh-Dompreh, during an interview on Adom TV interview, monitored by GhanaWeb refuted suggestions by supporters of Alan that Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia will not be a good messenger for the NPP for the 2024 elections because he is responsible for the economic hardship in Ghana, as the head of the country’s Economic Management Team.\n\nAnnoh-Dompreh, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Nsawam Adoagyiri said that Alan is equally responsible for Ghana’s economic meltdown because he is the head of the Economic Management Committee of the Cabinet of Ghana.\n\nThe 'evidence' he provided was a portion of a purported document of the Cabinet of Ghana which showed a list of members of the Economic Committee and the Minister for Trade and Industry was the chairperson of the committee.\n\nThe other members of the committee were the Minister for Finance, who was the “Alternate Chairperson” of the committee; the Minister for Food and Agriculture; Minister for Energy; Minister for Employment and Labour Relations; the Minister for Fisheries and Aquaculture Development; Minister for Public Enterprises; the Senior Presidential Advisor and the Presidential Advisor on the Economy.\n\nReacting to this in an interview on Adom FM on Thursday, February 23, 2023, Davis Ansah Opoku said that he is surprised by the actions of the Majority Chief Whip.\n\nHe said every Ghanaian knows that the Economic Management Team, which is set up by the president, is responsible for providing advice on the running of the economy.\n\nHe added that the Economic Committee of Cabinet only presents programmes of the various ministry under it during Cabinet meetings. \n\n“I’m surprised, this thing is being led by Annoh Dompreh and I don’t see that need for it… cabinet has sub-committees according to the sectors of the economy. Because all the ministries cannot bring their programmes to cabinet meetings so these committees collect all the programmes of ministries under them and present them during the meetings.\n\n“But when it comes to the management of the economy, it is the Economic Management Team that has been responsible for it since and nobody should run away from it,”  he said Twi.\n\nHe questioned why the chairperson of the Economic Committee does not address Ghanaians on the economy if s/he is indeed superior to the head of the Economic Management Team, who is required to do so.\n\nWatch the interview below:\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also watch this episode of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV below:\n\n\n\nIB/OGB",

This is an internal election… All the people who have expressed interest in contesting in the primaries are eminently qualified and they have all worked for the New Patriotic Party.\n\n“But when I look at the entirety of the eminent personals, I think that His Excellence the Vice President stands tall, no matter how you look at it – his competencies, his track record, his personality (how he relates with people), the digitalisation agenda that he is driving to transform the face of our economy,” he said in Twi.\n\nThe Deputy Minister for Energy, who is also the Member of Parliament for Sekondi, described Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, as a machine who together with Bawumia will transform Ghana.\n\n“It is my prayer that if by God’s grace, Dr Bawumia becomes our flagbearer, his running mate will be Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh. Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh is a machine and we need a machine to deliver,” he said.\n\nThe MP also said that he is confident that the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo government will turn things after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout it is seeking is completed.\n\nThe likes of the former Trade and Industry Minister Alan Kyerematen Assin, Central MP Ken Agyapong, Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, the former Food and Agriculture Minister, Dr. Owusu Afriyie Akoto, ex-Mampong MP Francis Addai-Nimoh and Regional Cooperation Minister Dr Kofi Konadu Apreku, are expected to face off in the race for the flagbearership position of the NPP.\n\nWatch the interview below:\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also watch this episode of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV below:\n\n\n\nIB/OGB",
    'The spokesperson of Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, Dr. Gideon Boako, has revealed that any of the candidates contesting for the New Patriotic Party’s (NPP) flagbearership who gets the support of five incumbent Members of Parliament(MP) in the Ashanti region will win the election.\n\nHe was also quick to shoot down claims from pro-Alan elements that Dr. Bawumia as flagbearer will reduce the votes of the party in the Ashanti Region; arguing that the Vice President has over the years endeared to the people of the Ashanti Region even more than candidates from the region.\n\nDr. Gideon Boako was speaking on Wontumi Radio when he made this known.\n\n“The Ashantis are not looking for people who will just say I can trace my roots there or they come from that place. They are looking for someone who will relate well with them and not have the boss, subordinate relationship.\n\nYou can be from there but you are not humble enough to have time for the party members. They see Bawumia and he is like a son to the Ashantis. He endears so much to the party and they know him very well. He comes for funerals and joins most social gatherings in the region. During campaigns, he’s the one they see. You can say you are from the Ashanti Region but have the people seen you campaigning for the party in the region before?"\n\nIf you want a position in the NPP and you tell the people from Ashanti Region that they have to vote for you, what the NPP members in the Ashanti Region will ask you is when was the last time you came to Bosome Freho or Ejura to campaign. They can say that Bawumia who you claim is not from Ashanti Region 2020, 2016 campaign we were with him in the Ashanti Region.\n\nThe Ashanti party is closer to Bawumia than anything. This is right from the grassroots. When we come to the Ashanti Region, you’ll get lots of the chairmen, and constituency chairmen following Vice President.\n\nOut of the number of MPs in the Ashanti Region, if any candidate apart from Bawumia is able to get more than five MPs supporting them, I will say they will win the election. Bawumia will have the support. Bawumia will get not less than 80% of the Ashanti MPs supporting him. When some persons who said they are from the Ashanti Region went back home, they had only two MPs behind them. But when Bawumia is in the Ashanti Region, he has full support from the grassroots upwards. This is an indication of who the people want. Per what I’ve seen, there’s no candidate who can command even 30% of the Ashanti Region votes apart from Bawumia,” he said.',

    'Lawyer Wahid Bampuori-Iddrisu has picked parliamentary candidate nominee forms to contest the primaries on the ticket of the National Democratic Congress on May 13, 2023.\n\n The Accra-based senior party member and legal practitioner has consistently contested the seat in Wa Central.\n\n This is his third attempt he’s seeking to annex the seat from the incumbent Rashid Pelpuo.\n\n The information available to GhanaWeb indicates that Mr. Bampuori-Iddrrisu (Esq) is the preferred candidate for most party stakeholders and stalwarts in the constituency.\n\n According to a constituency executive, among other things, “Wahid’s consistency and commitment to party activities though he lost the primaries on two occasions is giving him some sympathy and sense of acceptance”.\n\n The source added that Wahid has a very good message that is being delivered on a clean and honest campaign.\n\n The 56-year-old legal luminary was also described as genuinely generous, friendly, and well-networked enough to lead the party in parliament.\n\n "He was the first and only member of the NDC that has constructed and donated two party offices  which he built from his own resources to the constituency," the source added.\n\n The constituency seems to be drifting away from the 18 years of leadership of the incumbent and 12 years of neglect of the constituency by Hudu Mogtari to the generous lawyer and founding member of the party.\n\n The Wa Central seat will be keenly contested but critics observe that Lawyer Wahid’s team is too slow and seems drowned in the cross-fire between Rashid Pelpuo and Hudu Mogtari\'s teams.\n\n YNA/WA',
    "The Deputy Spokesperson for Alan Kyerematen, Richard Nyamah, has claimed that it is because a powerful person within the New Patriotic Party (NPP) heavily invested in the campaign of the sitting Member of Parliament for Adenta, Mohammed Adamu Ramadan, that he won the seat. \n\nIt is worth noting that the current MP is a member of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), but is also the sister of the wife of the vice president, Samira Bawumia. \n\nAccording to Richard Nyamah, the only reason Yaw Buaben Asamoa, a one-time MP for the Adentan constituency was unable to retain that seat is because of the contributions of this powerful person, who he described as Annoh-Dompreh's preferred choice.  \n\nHe said this while reacting to an earlier interview of the Majority Chief Whip in Parliament, Frank Annoh-Dompreh, on Adom TV, where the legislator dared Buaben Asamoa to win back the Adenta seat which has, for many years, been a New Patriotic Party (NPP) seat. \n\n“The Hon MP further went ahead to malign Hon Yaw Buaben Asamoa, former MP for Adentan and former Director of NPP Party Communications, now Spokesperson and Director of Communications for the Alan Kyerematen Campaign, by casting untrue aspersions on his person and character and then cheekily damning him to dare to win back the Adentan Parliamentary Seat, lost to the Party in the 2020 General elections. The real question is why and how the seat was lost. \n\n“If the Hon Annoh-Dompreh is not familiar with the story of how his preferred candidate for leadership of the NPP reportedly helped invest heavily in his brother-in-law to gift an NPP held seat to our main opponents, then he is indeed doing the High Office of Chief Whip an injustice. \n\n“It is the business of the Chief Whip to have his finger on the pulse of the Party but his aspersions in respect of Adentan Constituency show that either he is not on top of his game or that he has deliberately blinded himself to further the interests of his preferred candidate, even if the parliamentary preferences of his candidate have been hurtful to the fortunes of the NPP.  Now the question that begs answering is, will Annoh-Dompreh be singing praises to his preferred candidate if he was destooled by his brother-in-law from the NDC with the tacit support of the Vice President of the land?” he wrote. \n\nRichard Nyamah also refuted claims by the MP that Alan Kyerematen was in charge of an Economic Management Committee. \n\nHe indicated that there is no such committee and that if there is, then Frank Annoh-Dompreh should produce its members, as well as its mandate. \n\nMeanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:\n\n\n\n\n\nAE/OGB",

    'Director of Communications for the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP), Richard Ahiagbah has stated that the Akufo-Addo government is on course to restore the country’s economic stability and growth that existed before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAddressing the press at the party headquarters in Aslym Down, Accra, today Wednesday 22 February 2023, Richard Ahiagbah, said the government’s Post Covid-19 Program for Economic Growth (PC-PEG) is a solid blueprint that is ushering the country out of the economic setback the people of Ghana have had to endure the last 12months.\n\nNDC’s poor record\n\nBefore he outlined the recovery plans of the Akufo-Addo administration, Mr. Ahiagbah, took a swipe at the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) for what he says is a deliberate effort on the part of the opposition party to “misled many Ghanaians to think that [the Akufo-Addo government] has mismanaged the economy since assuming office”.\n\n“This claim by the NDC however is not supported by the hard economic data and the reality around the world. In all these, the NDC has not provided any credible alternative solution(s). They are talking a lot but not about solutions.  It is blame, mischaracterization, and denial of obvious global economic realities” Richard Ahiagbah said. \n\nSupporting his argument on the “poor performance” of the NDC when they were in office between 2013 and 2016, Ahiagbah said, “on the larger economy which is measured in terms of GDP the NDC, supervised a perpetual decline from 2013 to 2016”.\n\n“In 2013, GDP was 7.3%; in 2014 it was 4%; in 2015 it was 3.9% and in 2016 it was 3.7%. In terms of percentage changes in the GPD, the economy deteriorated by 45.2% in 2014 compared to 2013 growth. Similarly, the economy decreased by 2.5% in 2015 and 5.12% in 2016.\n\n“In the Real Sector, which includes Agriculture, Industry, and Service, the NDC’s performance was even worst. From 2013, real sector growth plummeted significantly across all sectors. In 2014 all the sectors grew at a negative rate using 2013 performance as a base” Mr. Ahiagbah said.\n\n“Let me remind you that this poor performance was against the NDC inheriting an economy that had discovered oil in commercial quantities and began production in 2010; which shot Ghana’s GDP to 14% in 2011.  All that growth momentum was vanquished by the NDC, led by Ex-President Mahama” he added. \n\nNPP’s outstanding performance\n\nComparing the NDC’s performance with the NPP’s time in office before the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the NPP’s director of communications noted that available data shows that the “NPP turned around the contracting economy it inherited from the NDC in 2017 to date”.\n\n“On GDP, 2017 GDP grew at 8.1 percent compared to 3.7 percent in 2016, 2018 GDP grew by 6.3%, 2019 GDP grew by 6.5% and 2020 GDP grew by 0.5%. In the real rector, the industry recorded its highest growth of 16.7% in 2017, with Agriculture at 8.4%, and the Services sectors at 4.3%.\n\n“Industry grew from a mournful negative 0.5% in 2016 to 16.7 percent in 2017 and Services grew from 2.8% in 2016 to an appreciable 4.3% in 2017,” Ahiagbah said.\n\n“The Agric sector also grew from a dismal 2.7% in 2016 to 8.4% in 2017. Friends from the media, this data we just reviewed imply that the vulnerable in our society, the poor, indeed, the vast majority of Ghanaians fared much better under NPP in 2017. Data is sacred” he added.\n\nRecovery plan\n\nAs part of the recovery plan, Mr. Ahiagbah said “Government has introduced the Post Covid-19 Program for Economic Growth (PC-PEG) to among others establish a sustainable macro-fiscal path, restore debt sustainability and macro-economic stability underpinned by key structural reform and social protection”.\n\nAccording to Richard Ahiagbah, “the PC-PEG will address the economic challenges of this country through fiscal consolidation, get treatment, and structural reform” and that “Government through the Central Bank has responded with a raft of monetary policy measures, including the bi-weekly FX forward auction, and the BDC forex auction which has helped subdue the pressure on the spot FX market”.\n\n“To complement the monetary policies which have been activated, the Government has subsequently announced Expenditure-led measures including a 30% cut in discretionary expenditures, a moratorium on the new creation of government units, a freeze on government travels, 30 percent cut in salaries of the executive and political appointees, among others,” Ahiagbah said.\n\n“Other policies such as the implementation of the Gold for Oil (G4O) program, implementation of the COVID-19 Alleviation & Revitalization of Enterprises Support (CARES) Program, to inject some Ghc100 billion into the economy” [are all part of the larger strategy of the government to the country’s economic stability] Ahiagbah added.\n\n“Government’s transformative agenda to digitalize the economy [which is aimed at formalizing] the Ghanaian economy & improve its administrative systems & global competitiveness, the banking sector reforms which has introduced a tighter regulatory & supervisory framework in the sector are all part of the steps government is taking to revive the economy.\n\n“Through these innovative measures, the government is demonstrating its resolve to build back the economy quickly and restore fiscal rectitude. Government’s commitment to these measures is a clear assurance that we are on the right track and capable of causing a turnaround of the economy with the resolute support of all Ghanaians” Richard Ahiagbah further stated.\n\nWay Forward for Economy\n\nIn his press statement, the NPP\'s director of communications identified several thematic areas that the government is paying attention to tackle the prevailing economic challenges.\n\nMr. Ahiagbah noted that in 2022, the government introduced a raft of fiscal and monetary measures to rein in expenditures and improve revenue mobilization, including a cut in discretionary spending, a cut in the salaries of the executives, a freeze on foreign travel, among others".\n\n"The 2023 budget indicates the government’s desire to continue fiscal consolidation efforts and reduce the fiscal deficit in line with the pending IMF Programme. The government expects to record one of the lowest deficits this year, much lower than the GH¢64.0 billion announced in the 2023 budget" Ahiagbah said.\n\n"Expenditure measures, the debt treatment program, and structural reforms, among others, are all measures that the Akufo-Addo administration has embarked on to ensure that the economy is stabilized and subsequently made to grow as was the case before the COVID-19 pandemic" Ahiagbah added.',

So we are looking at that support from them. China represents about a third of the $5.7 billion loan and so it is important that we engage them,” he said.\n\nNana Yaa Jantuah believes Ghana should not have degraded to a level that a team that mocked the previous government for going for an IMF bailout will now be drowned in debt borne out of mismanagement.\n\nHe partly blamed the nepotistic nature of President Akufo-Addo who is related to Ofori-Atta for the economic mess which she said had plunged the country into hunger.",

Elections are won by your character, by your good self – endearing yourself to the electorates, articulating your vision and they having the acceptability for you that you could be, and you are qualified to be their leader; not necessarily any name as such,” he explained. \n\nSpeaking with GhanaWeb TV’s Etsey Atisu in an interview on Election Desk, Francis Addai-Nimoh recalled how, for instance, he out-performed many more experienced names in the party during the 2014 presidential primaries of the NPP. \n\nHe said that because of the confidence the delegates have in him, he came out third in that race, even though he was regarded as the underdog in the race. \n\n“Similarly, in 2014, when the seven contestants, and I was one of them, I was seen to be the underdog; I was seen to be someone unknown in the political environment of our country. The other six contestants had all worked under J. A. Kufuor’s administration either as ministers of state, or deputy ministers of state, and Addai-Nimoh had not been in that position before. \n\n“But when we went through that process in 2014, I came in third, which was an enviable position that I secured for myself, and that shows the potential that the NPP delegates found in me and then encouraged me to make progress with this ambition,” he added. \n\nThe former Member of Parliament for Mampong also shared some other reasons why he is vying for the flagbearer position of the NPP again. \n\nWatch more below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAE/OGB",

    "Aspiring flagbearer of the NPP, Ing. Francis Addai-Nimoh, has advised Finance Minister Ken Ofori-Atta that transparency is key to winning the hearts of Ghanaians as the country continues to grapple with a debt crisis.\n\nIn an interview with Don Kwabena Prah on Happy 98.9 FM’s “Epa Hoa Daben” socio-political talk show, the former Member of Parliament called on Ken Ofori-Atta, to provide data to support the Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP), which requires pensioners and other bondholders to contribute to resolving Ghana’s debt crisis.\n\nIng. Addai-Nimoh urged the Finance Minister to compare the number of pensioners who have government bonds and the quantum of their investment with the investments of other financial institutions, such as banks and insurance companies.\n\n“At the beginning, my position on the issue was for the Finance Minister to provide the number of pensioners who have government bonds. Then the quantum of their investment. It was later that I realized the investment was around 2.2b. So compare that figure with the others, the banks, the insurance companies, and others. Then ask what the effect will be if the pensioners are exempted or added. “For me, it was just simple,” he said.\n\nHowever, Ing. Addai-Nimoh stressed the importance of transparency in the decision-making process, saying that the Finance Minister needs to provide the public with the necessary information so they can make informed decisions and trust\n\nIng. Addai-Nimoh believes that if the Finance Minister can provide the public with the necessary information, Ghanaians will be more willing to support efforts to address the country’s debt crisis. Ultimately, transparency will be key to winning the hearts of Ghanaians, according to the aspiring flagbearer of the NPP.\n\n“When he said we needed to help him for him to help us, that was a good statement. But then submit the spare sheets with the figures, bring them to the public so that we can understand why pensioners are in there, and with that, we can determine where the effects are insignificant or not. “Without it, they can’t trust you,” he said.\n\n“They have been exempted, and it’s refreshing to know, but we shouldn’t have dragged this issue to where we go.” The figures should have been provided so we know how much the financial institutions and their investments in government bonds total. So, if we decide to exempt pensioners and the consequences are minimal and we can still manage the debt situation, why not exempt them? “”Since they’ve been exempted, I’d commend them for standing their ground and expressing their displeasure,” he added.",

    "A former executive of the Tema East constituency branch of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), Stephen Ashitey Adjei, has accused former President Mahama of using empty promises of juicy appointments to deceive gurus of the party.\n\nIn the latest of his writings on happenings in the party, Mr. Ashitey Adjei, who is popularly called Moshake, accused the former President of secretly enticing some leading figures of the party with ministerial appointments to win them over.\n\n“It is not only Ministerial appointments, even the running mate position, Mr. Mahama is playing lotto with it by promising multiple people that he will make them running Mate,” Moshake wrote.\n\nThe accusation is the latest by Moshake who has been rubbing Mr. Mahama’s nose into his past mistakes which he says led to the NDC losing power twice in 2016 and 2020.\n\nHis write-up which is one in a series that he has been putting out since 2020 comes as the NDC slowly builds up toward a congress to elect its flagbearer for the 2024 presidential election.\n\nLike all other salvos that Moshake has released, this one is bound to rub Mr. Mahama sore because of the facts that Moshake characteristically laces with his punches.\n\nand the write-up is coming at a time that many in the NDC are tired of the Mahama brand and are looking for a fresh face to lead the NDC which has been under the Mahama influence since 2012.\n\nThe former constituency executive accuses Mr. Mahama of, “promising positions like confetti to NDC gurus just to win their favour for the upcoming presidential primary.”\n\nHowever, he vows that, “no empty promise will yield the loyalties of anybody because every single person in the NDC knows how neglectful John Mahama is. We remember how Mahama snubbed NDC members and appointed strangers like Raymond Atuguba, Nayong Billy Joe Alhassan Azong and others when he became president.”\n\nHe called on, “all the executives that Mahama has promised the positions to reject his indecent proposal out of hand to show him he John Mahama cannot deceive any NDC guru with the promise of position.”\n\nMeanwhile, Moshake has urged the party’s delegates to, “get with the wind of change and vote massively for Dr. Kwabena Duffuor to lead the party in 2024.”",
    "The National Chairman of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP), Stephen Ntim says the party is currently engaging stakeholders and would very soon come out with a timetable for the conduct of the party’s parliamentary and presidential primaries.\n\nAccording to him, at the party’s last Steering Committee, National Executive Committee and National Council meetings held on 2nd February, 2023, it was resolved that due to the importance of this exercise on the party’s electoral fortunes in 2024, there was the need for the party to build consensus among all relevant stakeholders before deciding on timelines for the conduct of the primaries.\n\n“At the right time when a broader stakeholder consultation is done and this decision is eventually taken, the Party would issue appropriate rules and regulations to govern the conduct of these primaries,” Chairman Ntim said while addressing a retreat organized by the Greater Accra Regional NPP Council of Elders at Peduase.\n\nHe further pleaded with party members to abide by these rules and regulations in the interest of the party.\n\n“I wish to reiterate the point that as national officers of the Party, not only are we going to be impartial, but will also ensure a level playing field for all prospective aspirants in the conduct of both the parliamentary and presidential primaries,” he added.",
    "Member of Parliament for Dome Kwabenya, Sarah Adwoa Safo has made her first appearance in parliament since the House resumed sitting on February 7, 2023.\n\n The third session of the eighth Parliament resumed on February 7, 2023, after the house went on break for Christmas and new festivities.\n\n Following the resumption of the house, Adwoa Safo did not make any appearance in the chamber even though she was in the country.\n\n Adwoa Safo’s absence from parliament was one of the most discussed topics in the country in 2022. The discussion came on the back of her leaving the country after the 2022 budget was passed on November 26, 2021.\n\n However, on November 11 2022, Adwoa Safo officially resumed her parliamentary duties following her return from the United States of America.\n\n Speaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, on October 26, 2022, ruled that the report of the committee set up to look into her case and that of two other MPs who absented themselves for a number of sittings should be presented before the whole house for a debate.\n\n Alban Bagbin dismissed the objection of the Majority Leader, Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu, to the admissibility of the committee report for the consideration of the house.\n\n “As I have noted in this ruling, the decision (sic) on not to admit a motion is the exclusive preserve of the Speaker. In view of the foregoing, the House is well within its right to receive and consider reports of the committee and make a determination arising out of the consideration.\n\n “In the circumstances, it is my ruling that the motion was rightfully admitted and the report of the committee is subject to the consideration of the house.

    "The Campaign Team of Mr Alan Kyerematen, a flagbearer hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) has urged the Party to hold its presidential primaries early to offer the prospective leader adequate time to prepare for the 2024 general election. \n\nThe Team has also appealed to the Party’s leadership to allow aspirants to campaign ahead of the date for the primaries to offer them enough time to engage with delegates. \n\nIn an interview with the Ghana News Agency, Mr Yaw Buaben Asamoa, Spokesperson for Mr Kyerematen’s Campaign, said the Camp would prefer the presidential primaries to be held in either August or September this year. \n\n“We believe that the earlier the date, the better. If we are to succeed ourselves as an administration, then it is important that we have the next potential President early so that the President can influence public policy going forward,” he said. \n\nMr Asamoa said if elected earlier, the flagbearer would have the opportunity to make input in the priorities and budgets of the Government in a manner that would positively affect the chances of the Party in the next general election. \n\nHe said the Party’s delegates also needed enough time to meet with the aspirants and assess their capabilities, hence the need for the Party to allow the aspirants to campaign ahead of their nomination. \n\n“If the nomination process is delaying because the Party cannot fix the date for the election, then it is difficult for the candidate and the Party itself because that space could be filled with activity between delegates and potential candidates,” Mr Asamoa said. \n\nThe NPP is yet to announce a date for its presidential and parliamentary primaries. \n\nThe Party’s National Council met in Accra earlier this month to decide on the date for the primaries, but the meeting was reported to have ended inconclusively. \n\nThe Party said it would engage broadly on the issue to arrive at a consensus. \n\nPer the NPP’s Constitution, the Party must elect its presidential candidate 11 months before the general election, when it is in power. \n\nMr Kyerematen, who has been working towards becoming President since 207, resigned as Minister of Trade and Industry last month to pursue his presidential ambition. \n\nHe officially announced his decision to contest the NPP flagbearership race in an address on January 10, 2023. \n\nIn that address, Mr Kyerematen said the country required a new plan to build a self-reliant economy to avoid going back to the International Monetary Fund in future. \n\nHe said if he succeeded in his quest to become President in the next general election, he would launch and lead the execution of the Great Transformational Plan of Ghana, which would span the period 2025 to 2030 to revamp key sectors of the economy. \n\nMr Asamoa said Mr Kyerematen had so far toured the Ashanti, Bono East, Bono, Ahafo, Western North, Volta, and Eastern regions, where he met chiefs and delegates to officially inform them about his decision to contest the NPP flagbearership race. \n\n“Everywhere we have been, there is the feeling that Mr Kyerematen is the right man in the right place for the right job,” he said.",
    "Mr. Gabriel Kwamigah-Atokple Tanko, a businessperson and National Welfare Committee member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), is lacing his boots to make a second attempt at the Parliamentary primaries of the party in the Ketu North Constituency. \n\nHe contested the primaries in 2019 but lost to incumbent Dr James Klutse Avedzi. \n\nThe aspirant, who has been touring the various branches of the NDC in the constituency ahead of the party’s Presidential and Parliamentary primaries slated for May, this year, made his intentions known in an interview with the Ghana News Agency at Dzodze. \n\nAccording to the business executive and professional who has served in various capacities in the NDC both in the Ketu North Constituency and at the national level and a member of the Volta and Ketu North Finance Committees of the party, he was compelled by the dream to usher in a new dawn for the NDC in Ketu North. \n\nThe hopeful as affectionately called Tanko as he is affectionately believes there can be no better replacement for the incumbent Member of Parliament (MP) Dr. James Klutse Avedzi who has hinted of his decision not to run for the position again, than him (Tanko).  \n\n“My passion and effort to contribute to the development of our constituency is paramount- the evidence can be seen across the Constituency since my civil service days- I am ready and prepared for the job like no other,” he said. \n\nMr Tanko, who is sure of winning the Ketu North NDC parliamentary primaries, intends to unite the party when he wins the constituency and national election.\n\nThe seat is being eyed by Edem Agbana, the immediate past deputy National Communications officer of the party.  \n\nHe advised all parliamentary primary hopefuls against a campaign of insults, attacks, and acrimony, which sometimes characterised political competitions and called for a change of the status quo. \n\n“It’s imperative that we avoid politics of insults and attacks on one another and rather focus on the messages we have as aspirants for the Branch Executives in the interest of peace and harmony going forward,” he advised. \n\nMr Tanko said his tour of the constituency affirms his commitment of prosecuting an issue-based campaign devoid of character assassinations, and all other unhealthy discourses that may frustrate intended reconciliation activities after the elections in the Ketu North constituency. \n\n“The gate of my house remains open to all NDC faithful, who truly seek the progress of our beloved constituency,” Tanko added as he campaigns on a message of  “New Dawn” (NUBUKƐ).",
    "The national chairman of the ruling New Patriotic Party(NPP), Stephen Ntim, has said that the party will have to perform exceptionally to win the upcoming 2024 election.\n\nAccording to him, the party is poised to make history by retaining power beyond the eight-year rule by a political party under the Fourth Republic.\n\n“We are seeking to do something no political party in the history of this country has been able to do. We are seeking to win a third consecutive general election. We are seeking to break the eight that has so far eluded the two major political parties in the fourth republic.\n\n“Obviously, to achieve this extraordinary and unprecedented feat, we need to do the extraordinary. We cannot do the same things we’ve been doing from 1992 and expect to achieve a different result, more so, when the result in question, is one that no political party in Ghana has been able to achieve. This consciousness is what I expect to drive our 2024 project. We must all be conscious of the enormity of the task ahead of us to be able to work our hearts out towards its realization,” Chairman Ntim said while addressing a Retreat by the Council of Elders of the Greater Accra Region branch of the party at Peduase in Aburi.\n\nHe added that the target of the current national executives is to ensure victory for the NPP come 2024 and nothing will stop them from achieving this objective.\n\n“Consistent with our mandate, we, as national officers, following our election in July 2022, set for ourselves, a target of working assiduously to retain power in 2024 to justify the confidence that had been reposed in us by the party’s delegates. This particular commitment to delivering nothing but victory to the party come 2024, has, at all times, been our primary focus in everything we do.”",
    "Ohemaa Borngreat, a member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) communication team, has berated President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo’s administration over its misuse of funds it mobilized to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nShe claimed in an interview with TV XYZ that the administration completely misappropriated over 20 billion (cedis) which is equivalent to one million five hundred ninety thousand four hundred fifty-seven dollars monies raised to combat the Covid-19 outbreak and is now seeking just 3 billion dollars from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by way of the financial bailout. which her claim is false. \n\nShe made these remarks while reacting to the government’s decision to include certain individuals in its domestic debt exchange programme. \n\n“By God’s grace, Covid is not a blessing but it is a blessing in disguise because when Covid came Ghanaians had a lot of benefits from the Covid. \n\n“So, if you’re a prudent government, couldn't you have invested the Covid money and we wouldn’t have even been here chasing the IMF for just 3 billion. \n“Whereby you had over 21 billion from the Covid fund. What did you do with the money? The Ministry of Information paid over 1.51 billion old cedis to themselves as risk allowance. So, the government has no vision for us,” she said. \n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, has calmed the nerves of pensioner bondholders, insisting that the government will not shortchange their legitimate rights but will honour their coupon payments and maturing principals, like all government bondholders.\n\nHe told Parliament that the government remained committed to the well-being and dignity of the senior citizens and pensioners.\n\nOn the other hand, President Akufo-Addo has also stated that the government’s debt exchange programme (DEP) was fraught with several challenges after its announcement, but it has largely been accepted by the citizenry.\n\nHe made this known when the German Federal Minister of Finance, Christian Lindner, paid him a visit at the Jubilee House. \n\nThe government has also announced 85% subscription rate for the DDEP which faced stiff challenges from a range of bondholders.\n\n\n\nAM/SARA",
    "Former Member of Parliament (MP) for Kwadaso Constituency Mr Samiu Kwadwo Nuamah has expressed disappointment in the New Patriotic Party (NPP) for playing mafia tactics in his constituency to unseat him during the 2020 elections.\n\nAccording to Mr Kwadwo Nuamah, his removal from the seat in the constituency was orchestrated by some bigwigs of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) at its headquarters in Accra.\n\n“People felt I had no political background so they decided to remove me from the seat by hook or crook. He has no Godfather, that’s all. So they do all those evil and call it Mafia. And somebody speak out with joy to say we have played him mafia.” Mr Kwadwo Nuamah told Kwame Tanko on Angel FM Kumasi in an interview monitored by MyNewsGH.com.\n\nHe further revealed that, the source of such power struggle in the party is mostly the fight between an MP and CEO of a government agency.\n\n“The issue of fight between CEO and MPs is very brutal, and it brings some kind of hatred to you. A typical example is myself. I was in the UK, sold my house, came down and did campaign. I had a 90% win in the constituency which is unprecedented, that after elections, every 9 people out of 10 will vote for you, it has never happened. The party should have even contacted me and learn how I was able to do that”, Mr Kwadwo Nuamah narrated.\n\nThe former lawmaker indicated that in most cases, people who are engaged in such mafia style do not build proper relationship with the party people at the grassroots.\n\nIn the 2016 Parliamentary election in Kwadaso Constituency in the Ashanti Region, Hon Samiu Kwadwo Nuamah polled 61,631 representing 90.0% while the NDC candidate Monica Bawuah had 6,263 representing 9.2% of the total votes cast.\n\nIn 2004 NPP candidate had, 83.2 with NDC 13.6, 2008 NPP polled 82.7% NDC 15.3%, whiles in 2012 the NPP Had 83.6% and polling NDC 14.5%.\n\nMr Kwadwo Nuamah was succeeded by incumbent MP for the constituency Dr. Kingsley Nyarko in 2020.",

The MPs believe that Dr. Bawumia is the best bet to lead the party, and I have no doubt in my mind that he will emerge victorious,” he said.\n\nThe Sefwi Akontombra MP dropped a hint that all the MPs canvassing support for the Vice President will soon come forward to unveil the cloak of anonymity for the public to know and recognise them.\n\n\n“We’ll be addressing a press conference to declare our support as MPs for the Vice President very soon. Dr. Bawumia is a Vice President who has shown majority and capability that he is the only person who can lead the NPP to break the eight,” he disclosed.\n\nTouching on the delegates, Mr. Djornobuah mentioned that about 80 per cent of the delegates would vote for the Vice President.\n\n“I know and believe that Western North, we’ll not disappoint the Vice President because it is time for us to reciprocate what he has done for us. And if we want more of such development then we need to vote for the Vice President,” he added.\n\nThe lawmaker pointed out that Dr. Bawumia is the right person to battle former President John Dramani Mahama in the Northern regions, adding that “with the support of our strongholds in Ashanti, Eastern and other regions, we can break the eight.”\n\nHe mentioned that the ruling NPP government has done marvelously well considering the challenges confronting nations across the world as a result of COVID-19 pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, yet the government is still embarking on infrastructure development, sustaining social intervention programmes such as Free Senior High School (FSHS), One District One Factory (1D1F) among others without Ghanaians experiencing power crisis unlike under the previous National Democratic Congress (NDC).\n\nHe, however, admitted that the NPP has made some mistakes in terms of governance, but was quick to add that Ghanaians are safer under NPP than NDC in terms of hardship.",

Joe Ghartey, presidential aspirant for the NPP, has met with the NPP Western Regional Executive Committee in Sekondi Takoradi, preaching his message of hope and unity.\n\nJoe Ghartey, who is contesting for the position of flagbearer of the NPP, said they should vote for him because he has the background, experience, and foresight to lead Ghana.\n\nIn response, the Regional Chairman, Nana Ndede Siah, stated that he was confident that Joe Ghartey could do the job.\n\nHe said that the region should support him not because he was from the region but because he could do the job.\n\nVarious contributors lauded Hon.

    "Former executive of the Tema East constituency branch of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), Mr. Stephen Ashitey Adjei, has opined that John Mahama as a flagbearer will be good news for the NPP. \n\nAccording to him, the NPP knows how to damage the Mahama brand and that having him in the saddle will be inimical to the chances of the NDC. \n\nAccording to him, “the agenda is nothing new, but in the same cast as the old plot to make Mr. Mahama, with all of his baggage of past scandals, become flagbearer again so that the NPP can have an easy campaign,” he wrote.\n\nThe NPP government has failed miserably and will be going into the 2024 election campaigns as underdogs. However, if they were to have somebody like Mr. Mahama as the NDC’s flagbearer, then the NPP would simply arch back and repeat their successful campaigns in 2016 and 2020, in which Mahama was framed as the most incompetent man to have governed the country, again.\n\nMany people in the party, including Moshake, have been fighting to ensure this dirty old trick of the NPP does not repeat successfully in 2024.\n\n“In 2020, we were here when the NPP’s Ashanti regional Chairman, Bernard Antwi Boasiako, alias Wontumi, revealed that Mahama had been ordered to contest as flagbeaerer so that the NPP can easily beat him.\n\n“Similarly, we were here when the Tema West constituency Chairman of the NPP at the time, Dennis Amfo-Sefah, alias Nana Boakye, also ordered Mahama to run and when he did we lost by over 500,000 votes,” Moshake wrote.\n\nHe added, “they are trying to repeat the same trick and Mahama has agreed to be the point man again. However, our promise is that we will resist this with everything we have because 2024 is not only about the fate of the NDC, but a mission to rescue Ghana.”\n\nHe called on NDC delegates to, “frustrate the NPP plan by massively voting to elect Dr, Kwabena Duffuor\xa0as\xa0flagbearer.”",

The (NDC) establishment is for Mahama,” Zuba said.\n\r\n“The people who call the shots in NDC are all on Mahama’s side. NDC needs John Mahama more than he needs us, the NDC needs John Mahama more than he needs the party. If John Mahama is not on the ticket, he loses nothing, all the treatment that will be given to a president and I mean any president that comes same conditions of services goes to him”, he revealed\n\r\nHe is therefore urging the NDC not to make a mistake by not giving Mahama the opportunity to lead the party.\n\r\n“We should not make a mistake by allowing just anybody to lead this great party to victory in 2024.

    "The chairperson of the Convention Peoples Party (CPP) Nana Akosua Frimpomaa Sarpong Kumankumah, has called on Ghanaians to consider CPP in the upcoming 2024 general elections. \n\r\nShe said that the party is better positioned to address Ghana's issues utilizing Dr Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah's 1960 seven-year development strategy, which she believes is still relevant today. \n\r\nSpeaking at the news conference held in Accra, on Friday 24, 2023 to commemorate the 57th anniversary of the overthrow of Dr Kwame Nkrumah and the CPP government, she argued that neither the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) nor the National Democratic Congress (NDC) has anything to offer Ghanaians and for that matter, they need to be voted out in the upcoming elections.\n\r\n“The duopoly cannot solve the problems. It is no magic, it is a formula, and as I said, success is duplicable. It is cut and paste. Once it’s working, cut and paste it…political independence without economic independence is meaningless, and that is what we are experiencing today,” she said. \n\r\nNana Akosua Kumankumah added that the NPP and opposition NDC had shown over the years that, they did not have what was needed to deliver the development Ghanaians desired. \n\r\n“The leadership is not supposed to be blamed.

    "Alan Kyerematen, New Patriotic Party (NPP) flagbearer hopeful, has indicated that he stands a better chance of breaking the eight-year mantra for his party.  \n\r\nAccording to Alan Kyerematen, with the current economic challenges in the country, what the NPP needed was a candidate who is appealing to the masses to enable the party to break the 8-year power chain. \n\r\n“I think the most difficult challenge that confronts us as a party going into the general election is finding a leader who goes beyond the NPP in terms of his or her own record. We need a candidate whom you can market to the people of Ghana but not just the NPP,” he said. \n\r\nThe flag bearer hopeful said this during a visit to the Upper East Region when he met with party executives, the clergy, traders, drivers, and supporters of the NPP.  \n\nAlan Kyerematen stated that winning an election in Ghana goes beyond political party and added that the individual leading the party must be appealing to the masses, “I think I fit the bill not just because I have been in this game for some time, but my appeal cut across political parties, religion and ethnic divide.”  \n\r\nThe former Trade and Industry Minister who also spoke on URA Radio in Bolgatanga as part of his campaign tour to the region said his vision about transforming Ghana that started about 22 years ago could have fetched the country not less than 50 billion dollars (about $150 per person in the US) every year if the vision had been continued. \n\r\n“So, you can imagine the transformation that would have occurred from that time up to now. As a country, it is time for you to have a new leader that understands business and understands how to move the private sector and support the productive sectors of our economy,” he added. \n\r\nUnder his leadership as Trade and Industry Minister, Alan Kyerematen said with support from the private sector, over 296 factories were established in different districts across the country in the past three and half years of the establishment of the government’s flagship policy ‘one district, and factory’. \n\r\n“Two years ago, when I started talking about producing and assembling cars here in Ghana, people were not so sure. But to the glory of God, now we have all the major global auto companies assembling cars here in Ghana. Volkswagen, VW, Toyota, Nissan, Kia, Hyundai, and very soon, Isuzu, Honda. All these things could not happen by chance but the result of a big vision and that is what you need as a leader,” he stated",

We undertake projects without records of stakeholder engagement, and when people raise their voices those projects become abandoned and we adjust to devising such projects. We have seen issues of misapplication of state resources.

Look at the way we execute contracts in this country as if there is no supervisor of contracts that the state has awarded. We do it anyhow and people benefit from that through poor supervision and poor execution of state projects. What is more, is that we see even some is that we see of these contracts ending up in judgement debt.”",

    "Presidential hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), Alan Kyerematen, has described the economic policies pursued over the years by several governments as a 'cul de sac.'\n\r\nSpeaking on URA Radio in Bolgatanga in the Upper East leg of his nationwide tour, Alan Kyerematen pointed out that the narrow focus of Ghana's continued reliance on cocoa, gold, and a few primary raw material exports, is a cul de sac orientation to economic management, and which has limited growth in the economy. \n\r\nDoing things the same way over and over returns the same results. \n\r\nCocoa, for example, has brought in under $2billion per annum into the Ghanaian economy annually over the past decades. \n\r\nHowever, the President's Special Intitiatives (PSIs), initiated by Alan Kyerematen, comprising four simple local products: salt, oil palm, cassava and garments, could have unleashed a potential combined annual income stream of $60b a year. \n\r\nHowever, policy distortion and irregular political choices reduced the nations' capacity to grow and benefit from the PSI's. Currently, the ten point strategic growth pillars developed and being implemented under Hon. Kyerematen, during his tenure as Minister for Trade and Industry, has brought in 1D1F, the automotive industry, and others. \n\r\nSpeaking to the Great Transformational Plan  (GTP), Alan inspires that the country deserves leadership with a big vision. A vision that moves us beyond the cul de sac into strategic growth areas following through on the GTP. \n\r\nAlan Kyerematen is also primary to the design, establishment and implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which brings together a market of nearly a billion and a half consumers for producers within the diversified economy necessary to expand opportunities for the youth. \n\r\nOn the same programme, Mr Alan Kyerematen reiterated his desire to modernise the New Patriotic Party (NPP) into a formidable force to better drive public policy and thence enable better mobilisation of communities towards opportunities. Not only will he create a businesslike Party, capable of generating independent financial, technical and human resources but also a big voice into Government appointments, especially at local level. \n\r\nThe Upper East Region is the tenth region to have been visited by the Alan Kyerematen for President Campaign after Ashanti, Bono East, Bono, Ahafo, Western North, Volta, Eastern, Oti and Northern regions.",

    "The New Patriotic Party (NPP) Member of Parliament (MP) for Mpraeso, Davis Ansah Opoku, has confronted his Majority Chief Whip, Frank-Annoh Dompreh, over his claim that Alan Kyeramanten was the chairman of the Economic Committee of Cabinet. \n\r\nThe Majority Chief Whip in a tweet shared on Thursday, February 23, 2023, provided ‘evidence’ to back his claim that the New Patriotic Party (NPP) presidential hopeful, Alan Kyerematen, was the head of the Economic Committee of the Cabinet of the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo government.\n\r\nFrank Annoh-Dompreh, during an interview on Adom TV interview, monitored by GhanaWeb refuted suggestions by supporters of Alan that Vice President Mahamudu Bawumia will not be a good messenger for the NPP for the 2024 elections because he is responsible for the economic hardship in Ghana, as the head of the country’s Economic Management Team.\n\r\nAnnoh-Dompreh, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Nsawam Adoagyiri said that Alan is equally responsible for Ghana’s economic meltdown because he is the head of the Economic Management Committee of the Cabinet of Ghana.\n\r\nThe 'evidence' he provided was a portion of a purported document of the Cabinet of Ghana which showed a list of members of the Economic Committee and the Minister for Trade and Industry was the chairperson of the committee.\n\r\nThe other members of the committee were the Minister for Finance, who was the “Alternate Chairperson” of the committee; the Minister for Food and Agriculture; Minister for Energy; Minister for Employment and Labour Relations; the Minister for Fisheries and Aquaculture Development; Minister for Public Enterprises; the Senior Presidential Advisor and the Presidential Advisor on the Economy.\n\r\nReacting to this in an interview on Adom FM on Thursday, February 23, 2023, Davis Ansah Opoku said that he is surprised by the actions of the Majority Chief Whip.\n\r\nHe said every Ghanaian knows that the Economic Management Team, which is set up by the president, is responsible for providing advice on the running of the economy.\n\r\nHe added that the Economic Committee of Cabinet only presents programmes of the various ministry under it during Cabinet meetings. \n\r\n“I’m surprised, this thing is being led by Annoh Dompreh and I don’t see that need for it… cabinet has sub-committees according to the sectors of the economy. Because all the ministries cannot bring their programmes to cabinet meetings so these committees collect all the programmes of ministries under them and present them during the meetings.\n\r\n“But when it comes to the management of the economy, it is the Economic Management Team that has been responsible for it since and nobody should run away from it,”  he said Twi.\n\r\nHe questioned why the chairperson of the Economic Committee does not address Ghanaians on the economy if s/he is indeed superior to the head of the Economic Management Team, who is required to do so.\n\nWatch the interview below:\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also watch this episode of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV below:\n\n\n\r\nIB/OGB",

This is an internal election… All the people who have expressed interest in contesting in the primaries are eminently qualified and they have all worked for the New Patriotic Party.\n\r\n“But when I look at the entirety of the eminent personals, I think that His Excellence the Vice President stands tall, no matter how you look at it – his competencies, his track record, his personality (how he relates with people), the digitalisation agenda that he is driving to transform the face of our economy,” he said in Twi.\n\r\nThe Deputy Minister for Energy, who is also the Member of Parliament for Sekondi, described Dr. Matthew Opoku Prempeh, as a machine who together with Bawumia will transform Ghana.\n\r\n“It is my prayer that if by God’s grace, Dr Bawumia becomes our flagbearer, his running mate will be Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh. Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh is a machine and we need a machine to deliver,” he said.\n\r\nThe MP also said that he is confident that the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo government will turn things after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout it is seeking is completed.\n\r\nThe likes of the former Trade and Industry Minister Alan Kyerematen Assin, Central MP Ken Agyapong, Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, the former Food and Agriculture Minister, Dr. Owusu Afriyie Akoto, ex-Mampong MP Francis Addai-Nimoh and Regional Cooperation Minister Dr Kofi Konadu Apreku, are expected to face off in the race for the flagbearership position of the NPP.\n\nWatch the interview below:\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also watch this episode of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV below:\n\n\n\r\nIB/OGB",
    'The spokesperson of Vice President Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, Dr. Gideon Boako, has revealed that any of the candidates contesting for the New Patriotic Party’s (NPP) flagbearership who gets the support of five incumbent Members of Parliament(MP) in the Ashanti region will win the election.\n\r\nHe was also quick to shoot down claims from pro-Alan elements that Dr. Bawumia as flagbearer will reduce the votes of the party in the Ashanti Region; arguing that the Vice President has over the years endeared to the people of the Ashanti Region even more than candidates from the region.\n\r\nDr. Gideon Boako was speaking on Wontumi Radio when he made this known.\n\r\n“The Ashantis are not looking for people who will just say I can trace my roots there or they come from that place. They are looking for someone who will relate well with them and not have the boss, subordinate relationship.\n\r\nYou can be from there but you are not humble enough to have time for the party members. They see Bawumia and he is like a son to the Ashantis. He endears so much to the party and they know him very well. He comes for funerals and joins most social gatherings in the region. During campaigns, he’s the one they see. You can say you are from the Ashanti Region but have the people seen you campaigning for the party in the region before?"\n\r\nIf you want a position in the NPP and you tell the people from Ashanti Region that they have to vote for you, what the NPP members in the Ashanti Region will ask you is when was the last time you came to Bosome Freho or Ejura to campaign. They can say that Bawumia who you claim is not from Ashanti Region 2020, 2016 campaign we were with him in the Ashanti Region.\n\r\nThe Ashanti party is closer to Bawumia than anything. This is right from the grassroots. When we come to the Ashanti Region, you’ll get lots of the chairmen, and constituency chairmen following Vice President.\n\r\nOut of the number of MPs in the Ashanti Region, if any candidate apart from Bawumia is able to get more than five MPs supporting them, I will say they will win the election. Bawumia will have the support. Bawumia will get not less than 80% of the Ashanti MPs supporting him. When some persons who said they are from the Ashanti Region went back home, they had only two MPs behind them. But when Bawumia is in the Ashanti Region, he has full support from the grassroots upwards. This is an indication of who the people want. Per what I’ve seen, there’s no candidate who can command even 30% of the Ashanti Region votes apart from Bawumia,” he said.',

    "The Deputy Spokesperson for Alan Kyerematen, Richard Nyamah, has claimed that it is because a powerful person within the New Patriotic Party (NPP) heavily invested in the campaign of the sitting Member of Parliament for Adenta, Mohammed Adamu Ramadan, that he won the seat. \n\r\nIt is worth noting that the current MP is a member of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), but is also the sister of the wife of the vice president, Samira Bawumia. \n\r\nAccording to Richard Nyamah, the only reason Yaw Buaben Asamoa, a one-time MP for the Adentan constituency was unable to retain that seat is because of the contributions of this powerful person, who he described as Annoh-Dompreh's preferred choice.  \n\r\nHe said this while reacting to an earlier interview of the Majority Chief Whip in Parliament, Frank Annoh-Dompreh, on Adom TV, where the legislator dared Buaben Asamoa to win back the Adenta seat which has, for many years, been a New Patriotic Party (NPP) seat. \n\r\n“The Hon MP further went ahead to malign Hon Yaw Buaben Asamoa, former MP for Adentan and former Director of NPP Party Communications, now Spokesperson and Director of Communications for the Alan Kyerematen Campaign, by casting untrue aspersions on his person and character and then cheekily damning him to dare to win back the Adentan Parliamentary Seat, lost to the Party in the 2020 General elections. The real question is why and how the seat was lost. \n\r\n“If the Hon Annoh-Dompreh is not familiar with the story of how his preferred candidate for leadership of the NPP reportedly helped invest heavily in his brother-in-law to gift an NPP held seat to our main opponents, then he is indeed doing the High Office of Chief Whip an injustice. \n\r\n“It is the business of the Chief Whip to have his finger on the pulse of the Party but his aspersions in respect of Adentan Constituency show that either he is not on top of his game or that he has deliberately blinded himself to further the interests of his preferred candidate, even if the parliamentary preferences of his candidate have been hurtful to the fortunes of the NPP.  Now the question that begs answering is, will Annoh-Dompreh be singing praises to his preferred candidate if he was destooled by his brother-in-law from the NDC with the tacit support of the Vice President of the land?” he wrote. \n\r\nRichard Nyamah also refuted claims by the MP that Alan Kyerematen was in charge of an Economic Management Committee. \n\r\nHe indicated that there is no such committee and that if there is, then Frank Annoh-Dompreh should produce its members, as well as its mandate. \n\nMeanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:\n\n\n\n\n\r\nAE/OGB",

    'Director of Communications for the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP), Richard Ahiagbah has stated that the Akufo-Addo government is on course to restore the country’s economic stability and growth that existed before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\r\nAddressing the press at the party headquarters in Aslym Down, Accra, today Wednesday 22 February 2023, Richard Ahiagbah, said the government’s Post Covid-19 Program for Economic Growth (PC-PEG) is a solid blueprint that is ushering the country out of the economic setback the people of Ghana have had to endure the last 12months.\n\nNDC’s poor record\n\r\nBefore he outlined the recovery plans of the Akufo-Addo administration, Mr. Ahiagbah, took a swipe at the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) for what he says is a deliberate effort on the part of the opposition party to “misled many Ghanaians to think that [the Akufo-Addo government] has mismanaged the economy since assuming office”.\n\r\n“This claim by the NDC however is not supported by the hard economic data and the reality around the world. In all these, the NDC has not provided any credible alternative solution(s). They are talking a lot but not about solutions.  It is blame, mischaracterization, and denial of obvious global economic realities” Richard Ahiagbah said. \n\r\nSupporting his argument on the “poor performance” of the NDC when they were in office between 2013 and 2016, Ahiagbah said, “on the larger economy which is measured in terms of GDP the NDC, supervised a perpetual decline from 2013 to 2016”.\n\r\n“In 2013, GDP was 7.3%; in 2014 it was 4%; in 2015 it was 3.9% and in 2016 it was 3.7%. In terms of percentage changes in the GPD, the economy deteriorated by 45.2% in 2014 compared to 2013 growth. Similarly, the economy decreased by 2.5% in 2015 and 5.12% in 2016.\n\r\n“In the Real Sector, which includes Agriculture, Industry, and Service, the NDC’s performance was even worst. From 2013, real sector growth plummeted significantly across all sectors. In 2014 all the sectors grew at a negative rate using 2013 performance as a base” Mr. Ahiagbah said.\n\r\n“Let me remind you that this poor performance was against the NDC inheriting an economy that had discovered oil in commercial quantities and began production in 2010; which shot Ghana’s GDP to 14% in 2011.  All that growth momentum was vanquished by the NDC, led by Ex-President Mahama” he added. \n\nNPP’s outstanding performance\n\r\nComparing the NDC’s performance with the NPP’s time in office before the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the NPP’s director of communications noted that available data shows that the “NPP turned around the contracting economy it inherited from the NDC in 2017 to date”.\n\r\n“On GDP, 2017 GDP grew at 8.1 percent compared to 3.7 percent in 2016, 2018 GDP grew by 6.3%, 2019 GDP grew by 6.5% and 2020 GDP grew by 0.5%. In the real rector, the industry recorded its highest growth of 16.7% in 2017, with Agriculture at 8.4%, and the Services sectors at 4.3%.\n\r\n“Industry grew from a mournful negative 0.5% in 2016 to 16.7 percent in 2017 and Services grew from 2.8% in 2016 to an appreciable 4.3% in 2017,” Ahiagbah said.\n\r\n“The Agric sector also grew from a dismal 2.7% in 2016 to 8.4% in 2017. Friends from the media, this data we just reviewed imply that the vulnerable in our society, the poor, indeed, the vast majority of Ghanaians fared much better under NPP in 2017. Data is sacred” he added.\n\r\nRecovery plan\n\r\nAs part of the recovery plan, Mr. Ahiagbah said “Government has introduced the Post Covid-19 Program for Economic Growth (PC-PEG) to among others establish a sustainable macro-fiscal path, restore debt sustainability and macro-economic stability underpinned by key structural reform and social protection”.\n\r\nAccording to Richard Ahiagbah, “the PC-PEG will address the economic challenges of this country through fiscal consolidation, get treatment, and structural reform” and that “Government through the Central Bank has responded with a raft of monetary policy measures, including the bi-weekly FX forward auction, and the BDC forex auction which has helped subdue the pressure on the spot FX market”.\n\r\n“To complement the monetary policies which have been activated, the Government has subsequently announced Expenditure-led measures including a 30% cut in discretionary expenditures, a moratorium on the new creation of government units, a freeze on government travels, 30 percent cut in salaries of the executive and political appointees, among others,” Ahiagbah said.\n\r\n“Other policies such as the implementation of the Gold for Oil (G4O) program, implementation of the COVID-19 Alleviation & Revitalization of Enterprises Support (CARES) Program, to inject some Ghc100 billion into the economy” [are all part of the larger strategy of the government to the country’s economic stability] Ahiagbah added.\n\r\n“Government’s transformative agenda to digitalize the economy [which is aimed at formalizing] the Ghanaian economy & improve its administrative systems & global competitiveness, the banking sector reforms which has introduced a tighter regulatory & supervisory framework in the sector are all part of the steps government is taking to revive the economy.\n\r\n“Through these innovative measures, the government is demonstrating its resolve to build back the economy quickly and restore fiscal rectitude. Government’s commitment to these measures is a clear assurance that we are on the right track and capable of causing a turnaround of the economy with the resolute support of all Ghanaians” Richard Ahiagbah further stated.\n\nWay Forward for Economy\n\r\nIn his press statement, the NPP\'s director of communications identified several thematic areas that the government is paying attention to tackle the prevailing economic challenges.\n\r\nMr. Ahiagbah noted that in 2022, the government introduced a raft of fiscal and monetary measures to rein in expenditures and improve revenue mobilization, including a cut in discretionary spending, a cut in the salaries of the executives, a freeze on foreign travel, among others".\n\r\n"The 2023 budget indicates the government’s desire to continue fiscal consolidation efforts and reduce the fiscal deficit in line with the pending IMF Programme. The government expects to record one of the lowest deficits this year, much lower than the GH¢64.0 billion announced in the 2023 budget" Ahiagbah said.\n\r\n"Expenditure measures, the debt treatment program, and structural reforms, among others, are all measures that the Akufo-Addo administration has embarked on to ensure that the economy is stabilized and subsequently made to grow as was the case before the COVID-19 pandemic" Ahiagbah added.',
    "The Director of Communications of the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) has stated that the party is unperturbed by the decision of former president John Dramani Mahama to run for president in the 2024 general elections.\n\r\nRichard Ahiagbah told press men (February 22) that having defeated Mahama twice (in 2016 and 2020), the NPP has no fears facing him for a third consecutive time.\n\r\n“We have beaten him twice, so you just conclude for yourself if we are afraid of him. It is all mathematical, and we have defeated him twice. He is even afraid to plainly declare whether he is going to contest or not. We are ready for him.”\n\r\nAccording to Ahiagbah, the NPP's major preoccupation now is to improve the economy and ease the cost of living crisis that citizens have been faced with for the past few months.\n\r\n“We are interested in how we can build our economy, and we want to know whether he has the solution because we saw him vanquish the gains that he got, and we saw him collapse our economy and banking sector. \n\r\n\"He doesn’t have what it takes to improve Ghana because if he had what it took to do that, he wouldn’t have vanquished our economic gains and taken us to the IMF,” he stressed.\n\nMahama declares bid, picks nomination forms\n\r\nMahama's formal intention to run for a third consecutive shot at the presidency was reported when a number of NDC MPs confirmed that he was going to contest.\n\r\nOn February 22, forms were picked on his behalf by Prof. Alabi and regional chairmen amid fanfare. Mahama is expected to address the media in due course to formally announce his bid.\n\r\nMahama’s political roots date as far back to the days of Ghana’s independence when his father served in the Nkrumah government.\n\nJohn Mahama, a political throughbred \n\r\nHe is reputed to be one of the most thoroughbred politicians of the Fourth Republic having served from the local level (Assembly) through to becoming a Member of Parliament for Bole Bamboi on the ticket of the National Democratic Congress.\n\r\nMahama held deputy minister and ministerial portfolios under the Rawlings government before rising to become vice president under John Mills and president when he took over from Mills then won his first full term in 2012.\n\r\nHe is widely expected to contest for the presidency come 2024 as he seeks a final term in office on the back of two straight defeats to President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo in 2016 and 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, catch the latest GhanaWeb TV Election Desk interview with Francis Addai-Nimoh, as he discusses his plans to become the NPP's flagbearer, below:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also watch this episode of People & Places here:\n\n\n\r\nSARA",
    'The King of Dagbon, Ya-Na Abukari II says media reports claiming he has endorsed Alan Kyerematen\'s NPP flagbearership bid are false.\n\r\nThe former Trade Minister, who has resigned from government to pursue his flagbearership ambition, called on the King of Dagbon on Monday, and after the visit, some selected newspapers published that the Ya-Na had told Alan Kyerematen that it was Alan\'s time to lead the NPP as flagbearer.\n\r\nThe King of Dagbon has categorically  issued a  disclaimer stating the reports are falsehood.\n\r\nA press statement signed by the Secretary to the Ya-Na, rejected the concocted reports and affirmed the Ya-Na\'s openness to the public.\n\r\n"The attention of the Gbewaa Palace has been drawn to reports in various newspapers regarding the courtesy visit by the Hon Alan Kyerematen on His Majesty Ndan Ya-Na Abukari II.

    "President Akufo-Addo has touted the Country’s democracy as one of the best on the continent, charging citizens to do all they can to protect it.\n\r\nIn a speech read on his behalf by the Chief of Staff, Akosua Frema Osei Opare, on the floor of Parliament on Wednesday, February 22, as part of the 30th anniversary of Parliamentary democracy, the President said Ghana’s democracy has not been achieved on a silver platter but by dint of hard work.\n\r\nSpeaker of Parliament, Alban Bagbin, praised the illustrious sons and daughters of Ghana for the role they played in entrenching democracy in the country.\n\r\nMajority Leader, Osei Kyei-Mensah Bonsu said in spite of 30 years of Constitutional rule, the country still struggles with issues of youth unemployment, Chieftaincy conflicts, insecurity, poverty, and corruption of all forms. However, the nation has much achievement to show.\n\r\nMinority Leader Cassiel Atto Forson said that though the nation has witnessed a couple of constitutional transitions, it has given democracy a chance.

    "Nana Adom Busia, a leading member of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) in the Wenchi constituency of the Bono Region, says endorsing Alan Kwadwo Kyerematen as a presidential candidate will enhance NPP’s chances to break the eight in the Election 2024.\n\r\nHe, therefore, called on the delegates, preparing for the party’s impending presidential primaries to remember and ‘stick’ to the NPP’s tradition and give Alan Kyeremanten the nod to lead the party to election victory.\n\r\nIn an interview with the Ghana News Agency (GNA) at Wenchi, Nana Busia said the NPP would be ungrateful to Alan Kyerematen, if the delegates failed to endorse him, saying “that will also cause doom for our great party”.\n\r\nHe said Alan Kyeremanten had remained loyal, and served the NPP wholeheartedly, after conceding defeat to President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo in the party’s last presidential primaries, stressing “we all know this is time for Alan Kyeremanten to lead us to retain political power in the next general election”.\n\r\n“For us to break the eight, I think Vice President Dr Alhaji Mahamudu Bawumia has contributed his quota, and it’s appropriate for him to retire with President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo”.\n\r\n“His retirement with the president will build and strengthen the internal unity we need to go for the elections. Other than that, it will be politically suicidal for the NPP in the 2024 general election”, he added.\n\r\nDescribing him as the choice for all, Nana Busia said “as a great party we can’t overlook our political history and pick any wrong choice to lead us because posterity would not spare us if we do so”.",
    "The General Secretary of the Convention People’s Party (CPP), Nana Yaa Jantuah has hit hard at the NPP government for keeping Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta, in office months after the country’s economy deteriorated.\n\r\nThe former Public Affairs Director for the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission (PURC) who was speaking on Power FM’s Inside Politics programme wondered why the minister was still in office after Ghana borrowed so hugely in a debt distress level.\n\r\n“Ken Ofori-Atta abon [Ken Ofori-Atta is incompetent],” she said in Akan while explaining that the finance minister is highly incompetent and unintelligent for allowing the economy to slowly grind to a halt amid warnings from experts.\n\r\n“When I call them F9 (unintelligent) ministers people want to come after me but that is who they are: non-performing ministers,” she argued.\n\r\nYaa Jantuah said times are hard that the working class and the ordinary people cannot afford a 3 square meal which was possible before the NPP took over power in 2017.\n\r\nThe hardship, she explained, was as a result of the inflationary spiral fuelled by a steep depreciation of the cedi which was not managed for a long time.\n\r\nTo her, President Akufo-Addo should have sacked Ofori-Atta long before the economy got crushed to a point that the country cannot pay for its domestic and external debts.\n\r\nExperts and rating agents have described Ghana’s economy as one that is in a huge debt crisis.\n\r\nFinding a way to handle the government’s debts internationally, Finance Minister Ofori-Atta recently disclosed that the government has initiated talks with China over Ghana’s debt following a successful Domestic Debt Exchange Programme (DDEP).\n\r\nHe told Citi News that negotiations with China are important because China holds the majority of the external bonds, stressing that he was to lead a delegation to China to plead for debt cancellation.\n\r\n“The big elephant in the room is China, we will be visiting China by the end of the week to really discuss how they come into the envelope as quickly as possible. So we are looking at that support from them. China represents about a third of the $5.7 billion loan and so it is important that we engage them,” he said.\n\r\nNana Yaa Jantuah believes Ghana should not have degraded to a level that a team that mocked the previous government for going for an IMF bailout will now be drowned in debt borne out of mismanagement.\n\r\nHe partly blamed the nepotistic nature of President Akufo-Addo who is related to Ofori-Atta for the economic mess which she said had plunged the country into hunger.",
    'The True Drivers Union says the decision to support former President John Dramani Mahama in his quest to contest the 20224 presidential elections is because he is fat competent, credible, and with the highest form of integrity.\n\r\nPublic Relations Officer (PRO) Yaw Barimah told Nyankonton Mu Nsem on Rainbow Radio 87.5Fm that the current New Patriotic Party (NPP) has failed its promises to Ghanaians.\n\r\nHe noted that in 2016, they supported the NPP and President Akufo-Addo, however, he has failed the people and exhibited high forms of corruption, incompetence, and mismanaged Ghana’s economy.\n\r\nHe claimed that the NPP promised to create more jobs and protect the public but has done the opposite.\n\r\nHe stated that they are currently destroying businesses and depleting our resources for their own selfish gain.\n\r\n“We expected better leadership from the NPP, but what they have delivered so far shows that Mahama is far better than what Nana Addo has delivered,” Yaw Barimah said. We had disagreements with Mahama when he was in power. But based on what we’ve seen so far, from Nana Addo, we’ll conclude that he’s clueless, incompetent, and lacks the qualifications to be president”.\n\r\nWhen asked if they were not doing this because they are NDC members, he recalled how they supported the NPP in 2016 and was asked if they were NPP members at the time.\n\r\n“We had a better life under Mahama. He far outperformed Nana Addo. Today is difficult for us. We have come to regret voting for the NPP. Ghanaians are currently facing economic hardship. Ghanaians are struggling. \n\r\n"We cannot afford the high cost of gasoline. Things are challenging. Businesses are struggling. We know that supporting Mahama is the best option.

    "Francis Addai-Nimoh has shot down claims that big names in politics give people an advantage over their peers in any political race. \n\r\nAccording to the flagbearer-hopeful of the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP), although it appears some of the personalities who have also indicated their intentions to run for the vacant role in the party are ‘bigger’ than him, that is not what will win them the elections. \n\r\nHe explained that it takes such attributes as character and endearment to be able to win the hearts of the delegates of the party. \n\r\n“Big names do not win elections. Elections are won by your character, by your good self – endearing yourself to the electorates, articulating your vision and they having the acceptability for you that you could be, and you are qualified to be their leader; not necessarily any name as such,” he explained. \n\r\nSpeaking with GhanaWeb TV’s Etsey Atisu in an interview on Election Desk, Francis Addai-Nimoh recalled how, for instance, he out-performed many more experienced names in the party during the 2014 presidential primaries of the NPP. \n\r\nHe said that because of the confidence the delegates have in him, he came out third in that race, even though he was regarded as the underdog in the race. \n\r\n“Similarly, in 2014, when the seven contestants, and I was one of them, I was seen to be the underdog; I was seen to be someone unknown in the political environment of our country. The other six contestants had all worked under J. A. Kufuor’s administration either as ministers of state, or deputy ministers of state, and Addai-Nimoh had not been in that position before. \n\r\n“But when we went through that process in 2014, I came in third, which was an enviable position that I secured for myself, and that shows the potential that the NPP delegates found in me and then encouraged me to make progress with this ambition,” he added. \n\r\nThe former Member of Parliament for Mampong also shared some other reasons why he is vying for the flagbearer position of the NPP again. \n\nWatch more below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nAE/OGB",

Then the quantum of their investment. It was later that I realized the investment was around 2.2b. So compare that figure with the others, the banks, the insurance companies, and others. Then ask what the effect will be if the pensioners are exempted or added. “For me, it was just simple,” he said.\n\r\nHowever, Ing.

He is still receiving attacks for the party and government, and you think I should sidestep him? All the current attacks from the opposition parties are being directed at him just because he has decided to sacrifice himself for the party,” he wrote on Facebook.\n\r\nKennedy Osei forcefully stated that there are positions being occupied and enjoyed by government appointees under President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo that are the results of the sacrifices of Dr. Bawumia, whom he further described as the nemesis of the opposition National Democratic Congress.\n\r\n"Many are today holding different portfolios and positions in this Government because of the work he did for the party then in opposition in 2016. He singlehandedly took the entire NDC government on, both in opposition and in government, so no wonder they are after his head and would prefer that he not be on the NPP’s ticket. He is the greatest nemesis of the biggest opposition party,” he added.\n\r\nThis latest endorsement by the Akim Swedru MP adds up to the overwhelming number of NPP parliamentarians who have thrown their weight behind the Vice President ahead of the party’s presidential primaries.\n\r\nThough Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia has not officially declared his intentions to be president, Dr. Gideon Boako, a spokesperson for the Vice President, has stated that the official announcement will be made if the party opens nominations for the primaries.\n\nYou can also watch this episode of People & Places here:',

    "Former Mayor of Kumasi, Kojo Bonsu, has said that Kumasi market women and the Ashanti Region love him because he constructed the Kumasi Kejetia Market Phase 1 for them.\n\r\nSpeaking on Asempa FM's Ekosii Sen, Kojo Bonsu said many people did not believe the construction of the market was possible, but he did it.\n\r\n“When I go to the market, the market women praise me; they say ‘you are the one we like’ and they praise me for the Kejetia market,” he told Osei Bonsu OB.\n\r\nHe explained that many people thought the project was not feasible, and the market women resisted relocation, but he managed to fence the place one night. According to him, the work had started by the time they came.\n\r\nKojo Bonsu has also said that the party can only win the 2024 general elections with him as the lead candidate and win the Ashanti Region.\n\r\nHe said the NDC’s bane over the years has been the votes from the Ashanti Region and he is the best person to curb that.\n\r\n“If I become the flagbearer of the party, the NDC will secure a lot of votes in the Ashanti region. This means I will break the monopoly and split the votes NPP secures in the region. Even today, the market women at Central Market and Kejetia Market are all supporting my presidential bid. The women have said that if I become the leader of the party, they will all vote for me.”\n\r\n“Today they see the vision and plan to develop Kumasi that we had,” he said.\n\r\nKumasi Youth Association (KUYA) in 2016 awarded Kojo Bonsu for standing out among all former Mayors of the Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly.\n\r\nAccording to the group, the innovation of the former mayor gave birth to the famous Rattray Park, Kejetia Market and renovated Prempeh Assembly Hall among other equally important monumental infrastructural projects in Kumasi.\n\nYou can also watch this episode of People & Places here:",

    "A former executive of the Tema East constituency branch of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC), Stephen Ashitey Adjei, has accused former President Mahama of using empty promises of juicy appointments to deceive gurus of the party.\n\r\nIn the latest of his writings on happenings in the party, Mr. Ashitey Adjei, who is popularly called Moshake, accused the former President of secretly enticing some leading figures of the party with ministerial appointments to win them over.\n\r\n“It is not only Ministerial appointments, even the running mate position, Mr. Mahama is playing lotto with it by promising multiple people that he will make them running Mate,” Moshake wrote.\n\r\nThe accusation is the latest by Moshake who has been rubbing Mr. Mahama’s nose into his past mistakes which he says led to the NDC losing power twice in 2016 and 2020.\n\r\nHis write-up which is one in a series that he has been putting out since 2020 comes as the NDC slowly builds up toward a congress to elect its flagbearer for the 2024 presidential election.\n\r\nLike all other salvos that Moshake has released, this one is bound to rub Mr. Mahama sore because of the facts that Moshake characteristically laces with his punches.\n\r\nand the write-up is coming at a time that many in the NDC are tired of the Mahama brand and are looking for a fresh face to lead the NDC which has been under the Mahama influence since 2012.\n\r\nThe former constituency executive accuses Mr. Mahama of, “promising positions like confetti to NDC gurus just to win their favour for the upcoming presidential primary.”\n\r\nHowever, he vows that, “no empty promise will yield the loyalties of anybody because every single person in the NDC knows how neglectful John Mahama is. We remember how Mahama snubbed NDC members and appointed strangers like Raymond Atuguba, Nayong Billy Joe Alhassan Azong and others when he became president.”\n\r\nHe called on, “all the executives that Mahama has promised the positions to reject his indecent proposal out of hand to show him he John Mahama cannot deceive any NDC guru with the promise of position.”\n\r\nMeanwhile, Moshake has urged the party’s delegates to, “get with the wind of change and vote massively for Dr. Kwabena Duffuor to lead the party in 2024.”",

    "The Campaign Team of Mr Alan Kyerematen, a flagbearer hopeful of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) has urged the Party to hold its presidential primaries early to offer the prospective leader adequate time to prepare for the 2024 general election. \n\r\nThe Team has also appealed to the Party’s leadership to allow aspirants to campaign ahead of the date for the primaries to offer them enough time to engage with delegates. \n\r\nIn an interview with the Ghana News Agency, Mr Yaw Buaben Asamoa, Spokesperson for Mr Kyerematen’s Campaign, said the Camp would prefer the presidential primaries to be held in either August or September this year. \n\r\n“We believe that the earlier the date, the better. If we are to succeed ourselves as an administration, then it is important that we have the next potential President early so that the President can influence public policy going forward,” he said. \n\r\nMr Asamoa said if elected earlier, the flagbearer would have the opportunity to make input in the priorities and budgets of the Government in a manner that would positively affect the chances of the Party in the next general election. \n\r\nHe said the Party’s delegates also needed enough time to meet with the aspirants and assess their capabilities, hence the need for the Party to allow the aspirants to campaign ahead of their nomination. \n\r\n“If the nomination process is delaying because the Party cannot fix the date for the election, then it is difficult for the candidate and the Party itself because that space could be filled with activity between delegates and potential candidates,” Mr Asamoa said. \n\r\nThe NPP is yet to announce a date for its presidential and parliamentary primaries. \n\r\nThe Party’s National Council met in Accra earlier this month to decide on the date for the primaries, but the meeting was reported to have ended inconclusively. \n\r\nThe Party said it would engage broadly on the issue to arrive at a consensus. \n\r\nPer the NPP’s Constitution, the Party must elect its presidential candidate 11 months before the general election, when it is in power. \n\r\nMr Kyerematen, who has been working towards becoming President since 207, resigned as Minister of Trade and Industry last month to pursue his presidential ambition. \n\r\nHe officially announced his decision to contest the NPP flagbearership race in an address on January 10, 2023. \n\r\nIn that address, Mr Kyerematen said the country required a new plan to build a self-reliant economy to avoid going back to the International Monetary Fund in future. \n\r\nHe said if he succeeded in his quest to become President in the next general election, he would launch and lead the execution of the Great Transformational Plan of Ghana, which would span the period 2025 to 2030 to revamp key sectors of the economy. \n\r\nMr Asamoa said Mr Kyerematen had so far toured the Ashanti, Bono East, Bono, Ahafo, Western North, Volta, and Eastern regions, where he met chiefs and delegates to officially inform them about his decision to contest the NPP flagbearership race. \n\r\n“Everywhere we have been, there is the feeling that Mr Kyerematen is the right man in the right place for the right job,” he said.",
    "Mr. Gabriel Kwamigah-Atokple Tanko, a businessperson and National Welfare Committee member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), is lacing his boots to make a second attempt at the Parliamentary primaries of the party in the Ketu North Constituency. \n\r\nHe contested the primaries in 2019 but lost to incumbent Dr James Klutse Avedzi. \n\r\nThe aspirant, who has been touring the various branches of the NDC in the constituency ahead of the party’s Presidential and Parliamentary primaries slated for May, this year, made his intentions known in an interview with the Ghana News Agency at Dzodze. \n\r\nAccording to the business executive and professional who has served in various capacities in the NDC both in the Ketu North Constituency and at the national level and a member of the Volta and Ketu North Finance Committees of the party, he was compelled by the dream to usher in a new dawn for the NDC in Ketu North. \n\r\nThe hopeful as affectionately called Tanko as he is affectionately believes there can be no better replacement for the incumbent Member of Parliament (MP) Dr. James Klutse Avedzi who has hinted of his decision not to run for the position again, than him (Tanko).  \n\r\n“My passion and effort to contribute to the development of our constituency is paramount- the evidence can be seen across the Constituency since my civil service days- I am ready and prepared for the job like no other,” he said. \n\r\nMr Tanko, who is sure of winning the Ketu North NDC parliamentary primaries, intends to unite the party when he wins the constituency and national election.\n\r\nThe seat is being eyed by Edem Agbana, the immediate past deputy National Communications officer of the party.  \n\r\nHe advised all parliamentary primary hopefuls against a campaign of insults, attacks, and acrimony, which sometimes characterised political competitions and called for a change of the status quo. \n\r\n“It’s imperative that we avoid politics of insults and attacks on one another and rather focus on the messages we have as aspirants for the Branch Executives in the interest of peace and harmony going forward,” he advised. \n\r\nMr Tanko said his tour of the constituency affirms his commitment of prosecuting an issue-based campaign devoid of character assassinations, and all other unhealthy discourses that may frustrate intended reconciliation activities after the elections in the Ketu North constituency. \n\r\n“The gate of my house remains open to all NDC faithful, who truly seek the progress of our beloved constituency,” Tanko added as he campaigns on a message of  “New Dawn” (NUBUKƐ).",

We are seeking to win a third consecutive general election. We are seeking to break the eight that has so far eluded the two major political parties in the fourth republic.\n\r\n“Obviously, to achieve this extraordinary and unprecedented feat, we need to do the extraordinary. We cannot do the same things we’ve been doing from 1992 and expect to achieve a different result, more so, when the result in question, is one that no political party in Ghana has been able to achieve. This consciousness is what I expect to drive our 2024 project. We must all be conscious of the enormity of the task ahead of us to be able to work our hearts out towards its realization,” Chairman Ntim said while addressing a Retreat by the Council of Elders of the Greater Accra Region branch of the party at Peduase in Aburi.\n\r\nHe added that the target of the current national executives is to ensure victory for the NPP come 2024 and nothing will stop them from achieving this objective.\n\r\n“Consistent with our mandate, we, as national officers, following our election in July 2022, set for ourselves, a target of working assiduously to retain power in 2024 to justify the confidence that had been reposed in us by the party’s delegates. This particular commitment to delivering nothing but victory to the party come 2024, has, at all times, been our primary focus in everything we do.”",
    "Ohemaa Borngreat, a member of the National Democratic Congress (NDC) communication team, has berated President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo’s administration over its misuse of funds it mobilized to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\r\nShe claimed in an interview with TV XYZ that the administration completely misappropriated over 20 billion (cedis) which is equivalent to one million five hundred ninety thousand four hundred fifty-seven dollars monies raised to combat the Covid-19 outbreak and is now seeking just 3 billion dollars from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) by way of the financial bailout. which her claim is false. \n\r\nShe made these remarks while reacting to the government’s decision to include certain individuals in its domestic debt exchange programme. \n\r\n“By God’s grace, Covid is not a blessing but it is a blessing in disguise because when Covid came Ghanaians had a lot of benefits from the Covid. \n\r\n“So, if you’re a prudent government, couldn't you have invested the Covid money and we wouldn’t have even been here chasing the IMF for just 3 billion. \r\n“Whereby you had over 21 billion from the Covid fund. What did you do with the money? The Ministry of Information paid over 1.51 billion old cedis to themselves as risk allowance. So, the government has no vision for us,” she said. \n\r\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Finance, Ken Ofori-Atta, has calmed the nerves of pensioner bondholders, insisting that the government will not shortchange their legitimate rights but will honour their coupon payments and maturing principals, like all government bondholders.\n\r\nHe told Parliament that the government remained committed to the well-being and dignity of the senior citizens and pensioners.\n\r\nOn the other hand, President Akufo-Addo has also stated that the government’s debt exchange programme (DEP) was fraught with several challenges after its announcement, but it has largely been accepted by the citizenry.\n\r\nHe made this known when the German Federal Minister of Finance, Christian Lindner, paid him a visit at the Jubilee House. \n\r\nThe government has also announced 85% subscription rate for the DDEP which faced stiff challenges from a range of bondholders.\n\n\n\r\nAM/SARA",
    "Former Member of Parliament (MP) for Kwadaso Constituency Mr Samiu Kwadwo Nuamah has expressed disappointment in the New Patriotic Party (NPP) for playing mafia tactics in his constituency to unseat him during the 2020 elections.\n\r\nAccording to Mr Kwadwo Nuamah, his removal from the seat in the constituency was orchestrated by some bigwigs of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) at its headquarters in Accra.\n\r\n“People felt I had no political background so they decided to remove me from the seat by hook or crook. He has no Godfather, that’s all. So they do all those evil and call it Mafia. And somebody speak out with joy to say we have played him mafia.” Mr Kwadwo Nuamah told Kwame Tanko on Angel FM Kumasi in an interview monitored by MyNewsGH.com.\n\r\nHe further revealed that, the source of such power struggle in the party is mostly the fight between an MP and CEO of a government agency.\n\r\n“The issue of fight between CEO and MPs is very brutal, and it brings some kind of hatred to you. A typical example is myself. I was in the UK, sold my house, came down and did campaign. I had a 90% win in the constituency which is unprecedented, that after elections, every 9 people out of 10 will vote for you, it has never happened. The party should have even contacted me and learn how I was able to do that”, Mr Kwadwo Nuamah narrated.\n\r\nThe former lawmaker indicated that in most cases, people who are engaged in such mafia style do not build proper relationship with the party people at the grassroots.\n\r\nIn the 2016 Parliamentary election in Kwadaso Constituency in the Ashanti Region, Hon Samiu Kwadwo Nuamah polled 61,631 representing 90.0% while the NDC candidate Monica Bawuah had 6,263 representing 9.2% of the total votes cast.\n\r\nIn 2004 NPP candidate had, 83.2 with NDC 13.6, 2008 NPP polled 82.7% NDC 15.3%, whiles in 2012 the NPP Had 83.6% and polling NDC 14.5%.\n\r\nMr Kwadwo Nuamah was succeeded by incumbent MP for the constituency Dr. Kingsley Nyarko in 2020.",

Same with COP Kofi Boakye and Chief Supt. Tsoboo we made contact with all of them and they all shared ideas with us.\n\r\nHe added that Dr Agordzo (A10), “even bought into the Medical Outreach program and supported the one intended for the Agbogloshie market with GHc2,000.”\n\r\n“I want to put on record that the Police, Military Intelligence, and BNI are purely engaged in selective arrest and prosecution of people of certain extraction because they did not find anything incriminating in my WhatsApp chats with Col. Ntem, A5 (Samuel Kojo Gamelie) COP Kofi Boakye, A10 (ACP Agordzo) yet they have fabricated stories against A5 ( Gamelie) and A10 (Agordzo) just for holding charges.\n\r\nThe Accused said “as to whether I have had any dealings with A6 (WOII Esther Saan Dekuwine) A7 (CPL Seidu Abubakar, A8, LAC Ali Solomon) and A9 (CPL Sylvester Akanpewon) I want to say that it was after my arrest and subsequent appearance that I realised they have been joined to this matter because prior to that I might have seen or met them once but did not know them personally.”\n\r\n“I want to put on record that the Citadel Hospital had 24hrs CCTV coverage capable of having both voice and motion recordings and considering that the nefarious activities of the prosecution and its star witness (PW3) could have been exposed if the CCTV and its accessories remained on the facility, the arresting officers removed the CCTV and the drives, carted them away and have refused to bring its content before the Court.\n\r\n“I say that if the Military Intelligence, BNI, and the Police want to show that they were aware that I was planning a coup d’état and there was surveillance, then they should show to this Court any recorded conversation I had with any of the accused persons prior to my arrest and not the manipulated audio and video recordings already tendered,” Dr Mac Palm told the court.\n\nVision of Take Action Ghana\n\r\nDr Mac-Palm, who told the court that he is a Medical Doctor by profession said until his arrest in 2019, was the Chief Executive Officer at the Citadel Hospital located at Alajo, Accra.\n\r\nHe said he was trained in the United States of America but returned to Ghana and practiced as a General Practitioner for over 10 years until 2019.\n\r\n“Because of my passion for helping the poor and vulnerable in our society, I have since 2018 been organising medical/ social outreach programs to help in educating the target audience on personal care and hygiene, social and personal wellness,” Dr Mac-Palm noted.\n\r\nHe told the court that “in view of my desire to increase the self-awareness and wellness of the ordinary Ghanaian, I joined a group of well-meaning Ghanaians to form a non-governmental organisation (an NGO) named Take Action Ghana (TAG) in or about July 2019.\n\r\n“The aims and objectives of TAG is mainly to mobilise, sensitise and educate the citizenry, especially at the grassroots. About their basic and fundamental rights. TAG also aims at speaking against the ills of our society- corruption, malfunction, nepotism, tribalism, bureaucracy etc. TAG also aims at joining the various groups pushing for the review of the 1992 Constitution for improved governance and development.”\n\r\nDr Mac-Palm said between October 2018 and January 2019, “TAG organised a number of Health outreach programs in cities/towns like Wa (Upper West), Otareso (Eastern Region), Asankregua (Western Region), Kpando (Volta Region) during which TAG delivered free Healthcare and donated drugs, about one hundred (100) bags of cements towards the construction of Healthcare facilities in these communities.”\n\nFormal & Informal groupings\n\r\nHe told the Court that, the TAG leadership planned to have several groupings (formal and informal) within TAG and it therefore purposed to have professionals or specialised groups for Economist, Traders, Teachers, Health Workers, Police, Soldiers, Legal, Banking, Accounting, Governance, Engineering, Sports etc.\n\r\nThe first accused said, “the leadership of TAG embarked on attracting and retaining some respectable Ghanaians including Dr. Mensah Otabil, Brig. Gen (rtd) Nunoo-Mensah, Ishmael Yamson, Arch-Bishop Duncan Williams, Mr. Brian Sapati, Sampson Anyeneni, COP Kofi Boakye, ACP Benjamin Agordzo (A10), Chief Supt. Tsoboo and others.”\n\r\n“It is worth mentioning that A3 was part of the early joiners and de-facto organiser for TAG, so he (A3) promised to engage Nurses, Soldiers, Policemen, and Traders for TAG.\n\r\n“I am aware that A3 made contact with his target audience in an attempt to propagate the ideals, vision, and the message of TAG. For that reason, he met some soldiers, policemen, and traders,” Dr Mac-Palm noted.\n\nAgent’s provocateur\n\r\nWhile narrating his side of the story he said “I was invited to meetings with some of the TAG targeted audience during which I shared the vision, message and outlook of TAG,” and “as a matter of fact, I have never in my life at any meeting instigated attendees to revolt against the Government or talked about Coup d’état.”\n\r\nHe pointed out to the court that “it was through A3 that I met PW3 (Sgt. Sule Awarf) who was very passionate and enthusiastic initially but later became Agent’s provocateur.”\n\r\nHe told the panel that, “PW3 (Sule Awarf) instigated about 90% of our conversations, topics and discussions. It is therefore not surprising that even his concocted audio and video recordings tendered in as evidence before this Court as Exhibit D had a lot of lull when PW3 was not talking/leading the discussions.”\n\r\n“I say that it was PW3 who suggested the need for us (TAG leadership) to acquire weapons for protection (after we were attacked by armed robbers during one of our outreach trips on the Bole Bamboi stretch of the road).\n\r\n“It was PW3 who introduced the discussion around getting AK-47 and even promised procuring some. He (PW3) again brought A2 as someone he (PW3) had worked with in the past and stated that A2 could manipulate pistols with further assurance that he (PW3) could get his superiors to have them (the pistols) licensed,” Dr Mac-Palm told the court.\n\r\nHe said told the court that “PW3 continued in the pursuit of his wicked agenda by planting the smoke grenades on me. This assertion is because he brought the grenades and stated that it is not dangerous but could be used to ‘blind’ people if being chased.\n\nOrchestrator\n\r\n“It is a fact that PW3 orchestrated the whole incidence around the testing of the pistols he caused A2 to manufacture at the Laboma Beach in Teshie so we could be monitored.\n\r\n“I want to state without any doubt that it was PW3 who planted all the exhibits tendered before this Court simply to win favour before his superiors (PW1, PW2 and others),” the first accused told the court.\n\n\r\nDr Mac-Palm told the court that “I have known A5 as a respectable senior officer of the Ghana Armed Forces through a former schoolmate (Col. Ntem) and both of them were patients at my hospital.\n\r\n“But our relationship was strictly doctor-patient and there was not a single occasion that we discussed anything bothering on revolutionary tendencies or coup d’état”\n\r\nHe told the court that on the day of “my arrest by the military men at the Hospital, I asked my senior nurse and assistant Carlister Badoo to call both Col. Ntem and Gameli to inform them of my arrest.\n\r\n“I know for a fact that the prosecution does not and cannot bring to this Court any evidence of prior conversation I have had with any of these two military officers as they have alleged.\n\r\nHe also told the court that the fourth Accused is someone “I met through A5 (fifth accused) when he (A4) accompanied A5 to the Citadel Hospital one evening.\n\r\n“We became friends more especially because he hails from the same village as me. He (A4) even recommended an IT person to fix my CCTV and fence my Dodowa residence as well as reducing the cost of communication via the use of a mobile phone type referred to as GOTA, which he said could cost GHȻ2000,” Dr Mac-Palm told the court.\n\r\nHearing continues on Wednesday, February 22, for Cross-examination",

It is through that the Accused got the Regional Crime Officer’s contact in which he gave to the complainant, Mr. Smith Danquah as the assigned police officer to escort the team.\n\r\nThe Accused person was subsequently arraigned before the regional commander where it came to light that the whole story was a hoax.\n\r\nDuring interrogation, the Accused admitted that his action was to solicit money from unsuspecting people including the complainant.\n\r\nOn the other hand, a second complainant, Yaw Korkor who is an employee of the first complaint, Mr. Danquah Smith came to the station to testify that the Accused person also ran away with a Tecno mobile keypad phone.\n\r\nAfter the investigation, the Accused was charged with the offenses of Publication of false news, causing fear and alarm, and stealing and was put before court.\n\r\nThe case was however adjourned to 14th March 2023 to allow the police to carry out further investigation following an appeal by the prosecutor.\n\nYou can also watch this episode of People & Places here:",
    "Asabka Alangi, who is being tried with Gregory Afoko for the murder of Mahama Adams, former Upper East Regional Chairman, of the New Patriotic Party (NPP), says he ran away after the death of the latter because his life was threatened. \n\r\nAsabka told the High Court that he run away to La Cote d’Ivoire after someone threatened to burn down his house, hold one of his children hostage and “one Toffique threatened to kill me as they killed my friend.” \n\r\nThis was during his evidence-in-chief on Monday led by Mr Andrews Vortia, his defence counsel. \n\r\nDefence counsel: you run away to Cote d’Ivoire immediately after the incident. Why did you do that? Tell the Court. \n\r\n“I was invited by the Police to come over right away, I was at Baba Apaya’s place, and not long after, I had a call from Toffique and he told me he had been to my house twice but did not see me so whenever they met me, they would kill me,” he said. \n\r\nAsabka continued that, I overheard him on the phone that he had taken away one of my children and will burn down my house and when they meet me, they will kill me like Ayibilla Atenga, my friend.” \n\r\nHe recounted that “on May 20, 2015, I was at Bolga-Kumasi Krofrom Number 3 lorry station and had bought foodstuffs for my wife when Gregory came to me that Baba Apaya, their secretary, had called for some NPP flags, so I escorted him but not after I had delivered the foodstuffs. \n\r\nWe went to Baba Apaya’s house and we were told he was taking his bath. Whilst we were waiting, Gregory bought a bottle of Guinness for me at a bar in front of Apaya’s house. \n\r\n“Apaya later joined us, and he also took the beer, after delivering the flags, Gregory dropped me at my house with my bottle of drink.” \n\r\nAt what point did you get the lift to your house? Counsel asked. \n\r\n“I cannot remember because I did not have a watch but I remember we watched the evening news at the bar,” Asabka said. \n\r\nTell the Court how you got the information about the death of Adams, Defense counsel. \n\r\nIt was the following morning when I was returning home after I had sent my two children to school, that Baba called that someone had poured acid on Adams so, I should come over to his place. When I got there, he told me that it was myself and Gregory who poured the acid on the late Adams, so, I should be very careful, the accused person said. \n\r\nDefense Counsel: Prosecution says you and Gregory conspired and between 2300 hours and 2345 hours on May 20, 2015, the day of the incident, poured acid on Late Mahama Adams at his SSNIT Flat residence in Bolga, what do you have to say? \n\r\nAsabka denied this and said Adams was like a father to him, he helped him in so many ways, including helping to build his house, he constructed an NPP office known as “Parliament,” where party members spent their hours playing cards. \n\r\nFrom the over 20 year-period I was with him, there were no issues between us, Asabka told the Court presided over by Justice Mrs Merley Efua Wood. \n\r\nGregory Afoko and Asabka Langi are standing trial over Conspiracy to commit murder and murder which they have pleaded not guilty to. \n\r\nThey have since been remanded.",

I was at Baba Apayaa’s [NPP Secretary] place when the police called me to come to the Police Station immediately.”\n\r\nHe continued that: “Not long after the call from the police, I had a call from Tofiq, [the 1st Prosecution witness] and he [Tofiq] told me that they had been to my house twice and did not see me or meet me, so wherever they meet me they are going to kill me.\n\r\n“He told me on the phone that they have taken away one of my children and burnt down my house.

He [late Mahama] was my father and he helped me in so many things. He even helped me in building my house.\n\r\n“He [the deceased] had constructed an NPP office which is called Parliament where NPP boys sit and usually play cards. I was with him morning and evening. There were no issues or problems between us. I usually work three times in a week at the station because we are many [at the station] so the day that I was not working then I go to the Parliament House where I usually sit,” the 2nd Accused stated.\n\r\nThe 2nd Accused who was speaking through an interpreter also stated that he did not know where Mr Afoko, who he had been charged to have conspired with, to commit the crime, lived.\n\r\n“I got to know the 1st Accused [Afoko] whenever there was a party [NPP] rally that is when we get to see each other. I don’t know where the first accused lives or stays,” he said.\n\r\nHe further told the Jury where he was on the said day, Wednesday, 20 May 2015. \n\r\n“From the morning of May 20, 2015, I was at the station working and usually we play cards when we are less busy.\n\r\n“And I went to a place called Worepisy which is within Tanzui where we normally play cards. I had already bought some food stuffs to send to my wife then Gregory Afoko came to me that Baba Apayaa had called that he needed NPP flags,” the 2nd Accused narrated.\n\r\nHe further narrated: “I told the 1st Accused that I have not been to school before so it is Baba Apayaa who is our secretary. I cannot read or write and since Baba Apayaa is our secretary, he should let me escort him [first accused] to the secretary.\n\r\n“We did not use the Main Street rather we used a different path where I brought the food stuffs to my wife before we moved on to deliver the flags to Baba Apayaa.”\n\r\nHe disclosed that upon reaching Baba Apayaa’s place, they waited at a beer bar in front of his house as he was in the bathroom.\n\r\n“When we got to Baba Apayaa’s place he was in the house taking his bath and there was a Bar in front of his house and we went to [sit] there.

Awal Akeresia also came in and the 1st Accused also bought a drink for him. He was also a party member.” \n\r\nAccording to 2nd Accused, the 1st Accused notified them that he was going to give his father some medication and so he requested that he dropped him off on his way. \n\r\n“The 1st Accused informed us that he was going home to give his father some medicine so I asked him to drop me.

But my Lady, let me draw your attention to another fact. In that same bullet point, LCs on the sight of goods shall be established upon the signing of the contract for every 50 ambulances. My Lady, Exhibit V that I have, speaks about purchasing brand new 200 medical ambulances. And so my Lady, the contract for every 50 ambulances that clause 4.2 talks about, was never done. And therefore, the LCs should not have been established at all,” Agyeman-Manu answered.\n\r\n“Will you agree with me that by the government of Ghana not complying with clause 4.2.1 in terms of the time frame for setting up the LC, the government of Ghana breached Exhibit V,” counsel further queried and the Health Minister said “I will like to agree with you.”\n\r\nThe Minster insisted that Dr. Ato Forson requested for the establishment of Letters of Credit contrary to the terms of the contract.\n\r\n“A1 (Dr. Forson) never authorized the setting up o the LC”, the lawyers queried. “There is evidence before the court showing he requested,” the Health Minister insisted.\n\r\n“And after the LC was established, you have not sighted any document that indicated that A1 Dr. Forson authorized payment to be made under the LC,” Dr. Bamba further asked.\n\r\n“I have not sighted any document,” the Minister stated.",

While Afoko is separately facing the charge of murder.\n\r\nBoth have pleaded not guilty to the crime and are facing a seven-member jury trial at the High Court in Accra presided over by Justice Efua Merley Wood, a Justice of the Court of Appeal sitting as an additional High Court judge.\n\r\nSo far, prosecution has closed its case after calling 16 witnesses while Afoko, who has been on remand for eight years also called a brother – John Ishmael Afoko as his only witness and has also closed his defence.\n\r\nIn court on Monday, February 13, Asabke took his turn in the witness box to speak for the first time when he was arrested from his hideout in Cote d’Ivoire.\n\r\nWhile being led by his lawyer Andrew Kudzo Vortia to give his evidence-in-chief to the jury, he said he had worked with the late Adams Mahama for over 20 years.\n\nThreats of death:\n\r\nCounsel had told to him “you run away to Cote d’Ivoire immediately after this incident” tell the court why you did that.\n\r\nAsabke in his response said, “the reason being that I was called by the Police to come to the Police Station right away.”\n\r\nHe added: “I was at Baba Apayaa’s (NPP Secretary) place when the Police called me to come to the police station immediately.”\n\r\nHe said, “Not long after the call from the Police, I had a call from Tofiq, (the first prosecution witness) and he (Tofiq) told me that they had been to my house twice and did not see me or meet me, so wherever they meet me they are going to kill me.”\n\r\n“He told me on the phone that they have taken away one of my children and burnt down my house. And also when they meet me they will kill me like the way they killed my friend Ayibiyo Atina.”\n\r\nHe told the jury that his friend “was slashed and killed in front of the ministries.”\n\nLate Adams like a father:\n\r\nWhen counsel pointed out to him that the prosecution or the police are saying that “you together with the first accused person (Afoko) between 11 pm and 11:45 pm on May 20, 2015, poured acid on the late Adams Mahama at his house at SSNIT Flat, Bolgatanga.\n\r\nHe flatly denied those allegations, saying “that cannot be true my lord that I conspired with the first accused to pour acid on the late Mohammed.”\n\r\n“He (late Mahama) was my father and he helped me in so many things. He even helped me in building my house,” Asabke noted.\n\r\n“He (late Mahama) had constructed an NPP office which is called Parliament where NPP boys sit and usually play cards,” he told the jury.\n\r\n“I was with him morning and evening. There were no issues or problems between us. I usually work three times in a week at the station because we are many (at the station) so the day that I was not working then I go to the Parliament House where I usually sit.”\n\nClose partner:\n\r\nSpeaking through a Frafra interpreter, Asabke told the jury that prior to the case on May 20, 2015, he lived at Tanzui and worked as a station master.\n\r\nAsked why he is in court he said “I am alleged to have committed a criminal offense .”\n\r\nHe told the jury that the late “Mahama had been my close partner for a very long time” and “I was working with him” for more than 20 years.\n\r\nHe further told the jury that “I got to know the first accused (Afoko) whenever there was a party (NPP) rally that is when we get to see each other.”\n\r\nBut, “I don’t know where the first accused lives or stays.”\n\r\nThe unfortunate May 20, 2015\n\r\nTaking the jury through his movements from the morning of May 20, 2015, to the time he departed Lovers-Inn, Asabke said, “from the morning of May 20, 2015, I was at the station working and usually we play cards when we are less busy.”\n\r\nHe said, “And I went to a place called Worepisy which is within Tanzui where we normally play cards.”\n\r\n“I had already bought some foodstuffs to send to my wife then Gregory Afoko came to me that Baba Apayaa had called that he needed NPP flags,” he narrated.\n\r\n“I told the first accused that I have not been to school before so it is Baba Apayaa who is our secretary. I cannot read or write and since Baba Apayaa is our secretary, he should let me escort him (first accused) to the secretary.\n\r\nHe said, “We did not use the Main Street rather we used a different path which I brought the food stuffs to my wife before we moved on to deliver the flags to Baba Apayaa.”\n\nBar: Beer: Guinness: TV:\n\r\nHe told the jury that, “when we got to Baba Apayaa’s place he was in the house taking his bath and there was a Bar in front of his house and we went to sit there.”\n\r\nHe said “I told them I will take one bottle of Guinness and first accused bought me one Guinness,” and then “Baba Apayaa after taking his bath joined us at the Bar.”\n\r\n“Gregory bought him a bottle of beer. Awal Akeresia also came in and the first accused also bought a drink for him. He was also a party member,” he pointed out.\n\nFather’s medication:\n\r\nWhile telling the jury that he “took just a little of my drink and left the rest,” he said, “the first accused informed us that he was going home to give his father some medicine so I asked him to drop me.”\n\r\nHe said, “I took my drink with me because I hadn’t finished it at the time and I told the woman who sells the drink that I will bring the bottle back because she is my sister.”\n\r\nHe told the jury that, “I can’t really remember the time because I was not putting on a watch but I remember when we were at the Bar their TV was on and we were watching the evening news.”\n\r\nAsabke said, “he (Afoko) dropped me exactly in front of my house then he left with his motorbike.”\n\nNews of Adams death:\n\r\nAsked to tell the court “how you got the information of the death of Mahama Adams,” he said “it was the following morning when I was bathing my two children to send them to school.\n\r\nHe added that “It was after I had dropped my children at school and on my way back home then Baba Apayaa called me that have I heard what had happened to the late Mahama Adams?”\n\r\n“And I said no, then he said someone had poured an acid on the late Mahama Adams,” and “so I should come over to his place.”\n\r\nHe said “When I got there, then he told me that everyone is saying that it is myself and first accused that have poured the acid on the late Mahama Adams” and “so I should be very careful.”\n\r\nAccording to EIB Network’s Legal Affairs Correspondent, Murtala Inusah, Asabke will not be calling any witnesses while the trial could officially end this month.\n\r\nState Prosecutors led by Mrs Marina Appiah Opare, a Chief State Attorney are expected to conclude their cross-examination of the accused on Monday, February 17.",

I was bundled into cells and locked up behind bars without giving my statement. After about an hour or two I was brought out and I gave my statement and sent back to the cells. \n\r\nEventually they came for me again from the cell, handcuffed me like a criminal and bundled me into a police car and we drove to my apartment. Kofi and the girl also followed us. The girl was asked to demonstrate or re-enact how the so-called incidence happened. She led the crime Officer and gave some shocking demonstrations; how I would supposedly come knocking on their window and she would come out and I would lead her through the backyard all the way to my apartment and some other unbelievable stories she was saying.\n\r\nAll these time I just kept quiet and was in handcuffs following them. The police took pictures of whatever they deem fit and we drove back to the police station. I was locked up again. Eventually I slept behind bars till the next day. \n\n\r\nOn Wednesday 9th February my father among other people came to see me and for the first time in my life I saw my father shed tears. He was so broken, livid, and furious because he knew I didn't and couldn't have done what I was accused of doing. In fact, upon seeing my dad and the fact that he was in such pensive teary-eyed mood, I couldn't hold back my tears. I cried bitterly. \n\n\r\nWhile in the cells all I could think of was, knowing the kind of country we live in and the justice system that we have, what would happen to me if investigation delayed and I have to be sent to court and remanded? How long would it take for me to be there before the truth comes out? What would have happened to my name and reputation while I remained in custody? In fact that whole night I used the story of Haman and Mordecai in Esther chapter 6 & 7 to pray. \n\r\nIn fact Social Welfare, Unicef and some journalists got involved in the case but fortunately the police didn't allow the journalists to pick the storey but Social welfare was deeply involved. \n\r\nBy 8 O'clock in the morning there were scores of people who had heard of the case and had massed up at the police station in support of me. In fact most of them spent the whole day at the police station (As I would later learn the police couldn't understand why all these people would mass up at the station all because of me and so they begun to ask who I am and what I do in the community).\r\nWell back to the story! At about 1pm I was brought out of cells and we (myself, the little girl, Kofi, my dad, my uncle, one of my flatmates, a Crime Officer, the police commander and another police officer) were locked up in a room for interrogation. At a point they asked the little girl to excuse us. Throughout the almost 1hr 30 minutes interrogation, I was not asked a single question. \n\r\nEvery question was directed at Kofi. He contradicted himself every step of the way. I was also called and interrogated alone and I maintained my position that I was innocent. I told the police how I think this was a ploy by Kofi to extort money from me because he and the girl had accused some Nigerian guys in the apartment some months back of the same issue and they ended up paying him money but eventually the Nigerians left the apartment so I believe I am his next target. And of course this was captured in my statement that I gave to the police the day I was arrested. Other flatmates also came to collaborate my story to the police. \n\r\nThe victim(the girl) was also later called into another room for interrogation and that is where she confessed that I was indeed innocent and that it was her uncle (Kofi) who has been sleeping with her and that she has never even entered my porch let alone my room before and that the demonstration she gave of how I would come knocking on their window when the police brought us home the previous day was a fabrication. \n\r\nKofi was immediately arrested and charged with defilement and assault (because he had beaten up the girl to pulp such that when the police first came to the house to arrest me and they asked me if I knew the girl, I said No because I couldn't recognize her plus she was wearing nose mask). \n\r\nI was released and I came back home that Wednesday evening. \r\nFew days after, he(Kofi) was ejected from the apartment because his rent has expired several months ago. Well it took me two days for me to find a new tenant for the landlord. \n\r\nKofi was sent to court within 48 hours and was granted bail but couldn't meet the bail conditions so he was brought back to police custody behind bars while the case has been adjourned to be heard on a later date. His family kept calling and pleading with me to talk to the police so that the case can be withdrawn and brought home but fortunately I did not make any complaints against him so I can't get involved so I couldn't get involved. Few days after I came home, the family came to me again pleading but I maintained that I can't do anything about the case as it is the state that has now charged him and prosecuting him. \r\nMy brothers and sisters this is how God delivered me from the evil that someone I considered a friend and have actually bailed him out from many troubles. I would later learned that he had spent a good number of months behind bars and was eventually bailed. \n\r\nAbout a month or two ago I was told he didn't appear in court when the case was called and that the police were looking for him.\r\nNot everyone you consider as a friend is a friend indeed. Lord I am grateful for your goodness",

The complainant then introduced herself as the head of Adenta Municipal Social Welfare Officer and informed Edward that she was calling to “get custody” of the baby. \n\r\nIt said when Edward heard this, he informed the complainant that his phone battery was draining fast and promised to get back to her. \n\r\nThe prosecution said Edward, however, did not get back to the complainant as promised. The complainant and her team proceeded to the health Centre but met neither the baby nor the accused persons. \n\r\nIt said the nurses on duty confirmed that they directed the couple to send the baby to the Police after administering care to him. \n\r\nThe prosecution said all efforts made by the officials of the Department of Social Welfare to trace the couple or the baby failed. \n\r\nIt said the complainant, therefore, reported the incident to the Police. \n\r\nThe prosecution said the Police together with the complainant went to the health centre where the contact number of Naomi was obtained. \n\r\nWhen Naomi was contacted by the Police, she informed the Police that the baby was in her custody but several appeals to either report at the Police station with baby or give directions to her house to enable the Police to take custody of the baby yielded no results. \n\r\nThe prosecution said after several calls to Edward, the Police managed to establish contact with him, and he promised to be at the Police Station but failed to do so. \n\r\nIt said several calls made by the Police to get Edward to deliver the baby to the Police Station yielded no results. \n\r\nThe Court heard that Edward, during one of the calls, told the Police that “he would resist any attempt by the Department of Social welfare to take the baby away from him and his wife.” \n\r\nEdward, however, reported at the station but without the baby.  \n\r\nThe police, therefore, escorted Edward to his house at New Legon where the baby was found in the custody of Naomi, his wife. \n\r\nIt said the baby was rescued and Naomi was also arrested.  \n\r\nDuring investigation, Naomi in her caution statement admitted that after the initial report to the Police, she “developed a special love for the baby and she had wanted to keep him.” \n\r\n It said when Naomi informed her husband, Edward, he agreed to her decision to keep the baby.\n\nYou can also watch this edition of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV:",
    "Justice Clemence Jackson Honyenuga, the Judge trying Dr Stephen Opuni, a Former Chief Executive of COCOBOD and two others, says he has little time left to hear the case to its logical conclusion. \n\r\n“It is with a heavy heart that he had to adjourn the matter on Wednesday, February 8, 2023,” he said, adding that it was very unfortunate that the case had to be “adjourned again at this time,” where a lot of noise had been made about the delay in the trial.  \n\r\nJustice Honyenuga made these comments after Mr Nutifafa Nutsukpui, the Counsel for Seidu Agongo, told the Court that his client was unwell and had to be admitted at the 37 Military Hospital after undergoing a review the previous day at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra. \n\r\nDr Opuni and Mr Agongo, a Businessman, are facing 27 charges, including defrauding by false pretences, wilfully causing financial loss to the State, money laundering, and corruption by public officers in contravention of the Public Procurement Act. \n\r\nThey have both pleaded not guilty to the charges and are on a GH¢300,000.00 self-recognizance bail, each. \n\r\nMr Nutsukpui said told the Court that while his client was at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, they understood that either the Attorney General sent some officers to verify that indeed Mr Agongo was receiving treatment or being at the Hospital. \n\r\nHe said as a result of that intervention, Agongo was at the Hospital till between 4 pm to 5 pm and when he got home, still unwell, he was sent to the 37 Military Hospital, where he was admitted. \n\r\n“As we speak, we understand that Doctors are conducting a series of tests, including MRI scan are being run on him,” he said.  \n\r\nMrs Stella Ohene-Appiah, Principal State Attorney, said the prosecution was unable to confirm what the counsel for Agongo had communicated to the court about the intervention of the Attorney-General. \n\r\nAbout, the admission of the accused person, Mrs Ohene-Appiah said this was the first time the prosecution was hearing this information since they do not have any documentation to show or prove it but “we will leave it to the discretion of the court.” \n\r\nAt this stage, the court intervened, asking the counsel where he got the information about the attorney general’s intervention and  Nutsukpui said the information was relied on by the Doctors, who treated  Agongo at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital. \n\r\nHe said the defence got the information from Benson Nutsukpui, the initial counsel for Agongo and it was their prayer that considering the absence of the accused person due to his ill health, the court should adjourn the matter. \n\r\nThe Counsel said by that time, the accused person would have been in the right position to provide the court with further and necessary documents to the court. \n\r\nJustice Honyenuga, therefore, ordered the Principal State Attorney to find out from the Attorney-General, whether he had sent any person (s) to verify from Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, whether the accused person had attended a review on February 7, 2023, and report to the Court at the adjourned date. \n\r\nMeanwhile, the Court had also ordered the Registrar to visit 37 Military Hospital to find out whether indeed the accused person was on admission at the facility. \n\r\nThe Registrar will report his finding to the Court on the next adjourned date. \n\r\nThe Judge said the trial commenced seriously in May 2018, even though the warrant for the trial was given on March 16, 2018. \n\r\nHe said in that circumstance and not to come back for another adjournment, “l will adjourn to Monday, February 13, 2023, to enable the accused person to present for proceedings to continue.” \n\r\nIt is further ordered that the accused person shall produce before the Court, a medical report on his admission at the 37 Military Hospital on the next adjourn date.\n\nYou can also watch this edition of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV:",

When the case was called by the Court presided over by Mr. Fred Obikyere, the Prosecutor, ACP Blagodzi, presented the accused, Razak Koampa Avoliya, 32 years of age, and read the charge formally preferred against him.\n\r\nACP Blagodzi charged the Constituency Youth Organizer with breaching Section 207 of the Criminal and Other Offences Law, Act 29, with, ‘Offensive Conduct conducive to breach of peace’.\n\r\nACP Blagodzi had referred to a social media video in which the Suame Constituency Youth Organizer allegedly made some comments allegedly inciting members of his party in the constituency to arm themselves in defense during the 2024 electioneering if they were attacked by members of the NPP in order to win the polls.\n\r\nIn urging the Court to remand the accused person, ACP Blagodzi explained that, if Razak were granted bail, he could interfere with the Police’ investigation into the case.\n\r\nThe Police Prosecutor told the Court that, it was the Police who pursued Razak and eventually arrested him and that a bail for him would not auger well for further investigation.\n\r\nThis claim by the Police Prosecutor was however countered by the head of the defence Counsel, Lawyer Evans Amankwaah, who informed the court that the accused surrendered himself to the Sofoline police on Wednesday, February 8, 2023, in the company of his Counsel and party executives. This claim was corroborated by the CID in charge of the case.\n\r\nIn opposing the pleas by the Prosecutor against the grant of a bail, defense counsel argued that, since the accused person voluntarily surrendered himself to the Police, he did not pose any risk to the investigation and was not a flight risk.\n\r\nLawyer Amankwaa argued further that the accused person had persons of substance, including himself as the defense counsel, to stand surety for him. He accused the Police Prosecutor of misinterpreting what the accused person said in the viral video. The presiding Judge, Mr. Fred Obikyere, said the fact that the accused person had willingly submitted himself to the police was indicative that he was ready to cooperate with further investigations.\n\r\nMr. Obikyere noted that however, based on the utterances of the accused in the said viral video, granting him bail could create anarchy and chaos in the society stressing that, the remarks of Razak has serious national security implications hence must be held in Police custody.\n\r\nThe court asked that the accused person be brought again before the court on Tuesday, February 14, which coincidentally will be Valentine’s Day.\n\r\nSpeaking to the media later in an interview, lead Counsel for the accused, Lawyer Evans Amankwaah, said even though whether or not to grant a bail application is a discretionary matter for the presiding judge, he disagreed with the court’s decision.\n\nYou can also watch this edition of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV:",

    "Heart diseases have become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Ghana.\n\r\nAccording to the Director-General of Ghana Health Service, more than 600,000 people, including 400,000females and 200,000 men are diagnosed with high blood pressure every year, with many more affected people remaining undiagnosed.\r\nHeart disease is a general term that includes many types of heart problems affecting anyone, including children.\n\r\nBecause it affects such a large percentage of the population, it’s important that everyone knows facts about heart disease and signs and symptoms to look out for.\n\r\nThere are many different types of heart disease with various causes that range from genetic factors to lifestyle choices or health events that can affect the heart, such as damage from infection. Some pre-existing conditions in the body may put an individual more at risk for developing heart disease, such as age,\xa0high blood pressure (hypertension),\xa0high cholesterol\xa0and\xa0diabetes, overweight or obesity, lack of exercise, family history.\n\r\nGlobally heart diseases are attributed to hypertension, diabetes, physical inactivity and overweight and obesity. No matter the cause, it’s a good idea to be aware of signs and symptoms of the different types of heart disease so that any potential problems can be caught early and treated appropriately. Here are a few of the most common types of heart disease.\n\nCoronary artery disease\n\r\nCoronary artery disease\xa0affects the blood vessels of the heart. Like the pipes in our homes, the arteries around the heart can develop a build-up of plaque that narrow the passage. This narrowing can sometimes cause a complete blockage resulting in poor blood flow to certain parts of the heart, which can lead to a heart attack. \n\r\nWhile coronary artery disease is often discovered after a person has suffered a\xa0heart attack, we should be aware of signs of coronary artery disease that can help lead to early diagnosis and treatment, as well as prevention.\n\nSigns and symptoms of coronary artery disease include:\n\r\nChest pain, tightness, pressure or discomfort (also known as angina)\n\r\nShortness of breath\n\r\nNausea (typically specific to women)\n\r\nExtreme fatigue (typically specific to women)\n\nArrhythmias\n\r\nArrhythmias are heart problems related to the\xa0speed and rhythm of the heartbeat.\n\r\nArrhythmias can cause the heartbeat to be too slow, too fast or irregular. If the rhythm of the heart is ‘off’, it can prevent the heart from having enough force to send the blood out to the rest of the body. When the heart beats faster than normal, it is called tachycardia.\n\r\nWhen the heart beats too slowly, it is called bradycardia. The most common type of arrhythmia is\xa0atrial fibrillation, which causes an irregular and fast heartbeat.\n\nSigns and symptoms of arrhythmias include:\n\r\nFluttering in the chest\n\r\nRacing heartbeat (tachycardia)\n\r\nSlow heartbeat (bradycardia)\n\r\nChest pain or discomfort\n\r\nShortness of breath\n\r\nFainting(syncope) or near fainting\n\r\nLightheadedness\n\nCongenital heart defects (CHDs)\n\r\nCongenital heart defects (CHDs) are problems with the structure of the heart.\r\nCongenital means that that the problems are present at birth. These defects happen when a baby's heart doesn't develop normally during pregnancy. Congenital heart defects can change the way the heart pumps blood. They may make blood flow too slowly, go the wrong way, or block it completely.\n\nCongenital heart defect symptoms include:\n\r\nPale gray or blue skin or lips\n\r\nSwelling in the legs, belly area or areas around the eyes\n\r\nIn an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain\n\nHeart failure\n\r\nHeart failure\xa0is a condition in which your heart can’t pump enough blood to meet your body’s needs. Heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop beating. Usually, this is because your heart muscle is too weak to “squeeze” out enough blood with each beat, your organs may not work well, which can cause serious problems.\n\r\nHeart failure can happen at any age, but it can be found most often in older people. It’s a serious condition — and also quite common. Many people with heart failure continue to have a full and active life for many years after their diagnosis.\n\r\nSymptoms of heart failure vary based on the type of heart failure you have. \n\r\nCommon symptoms include:\n\r\nShortness of breath\n\r\nCough\n\r\nFeeling very tired and weak\n\r\nWeight gain (from fluid buildup)\n\r\nSwollen ankles, feet, belly, lower back, and fingers\n\r\nPuffiness or swelling around the eyes\n\r\nTrouble concentrating or remembering\n\nHeart valve disease\n\r\nThe heart has four valves that help it pump efficiently- the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic valves. The valves have flaps that open and close to move blood through the heart to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards When the valves or heart tissues aren’t working properly, the blood isn’t able to flow through the heart and out to the rest of the body. For example, blood can become ‘stuck’ in the chambers of the heart and begin to clot, which puts a person at risk for a stroke.\n\nSigns and symptoms of heart valve and structural heart disease include\n\r\nFatigue\n\r\nShortness of breath, especially with activity or when laying down\n\r\nIrregular heartbeat\n\r\nSwollen feet or ankles\n\r\nFainting\n\r\nAbnormal sound (heart murmur) when heard with a stethoscope\n\nNote: No matter the symptoms or signs, if you suspect that you may be experiencing any of the above, it’s a good idea to get seen quickly by a medical professional for diagnosis and treatment.",
    "Nana Ansu Ababio, the Chief of Yawhima has ordered the closure of the Yawhima Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) Primary and Junior High School in the Sunyani Municipality for fear of an outbreak of respiratory diseases among school children.\n\r\nDuring a visit by the Ghana News Agency (GNA) around 0800 hours on Thursday, there was no child or a teacher in the school, along the Yawhima portion of the Sunyani-Techiman highway, and all the classrooms were locked up.\n\r\nThe GNA said the school was closed since Monday, February 20, 2023, and the children had since remained in the house.\n\r\nSpeaking in an interview with the GNA, Nana Ababio said the decision to close the school was taken because the school children and the teachers could not stand the dust from the untarred road.\n\r\nHe said if immediate measures were not taken to put the worsened condition of the road into good shape to save residents from the dust, there could be an outbreak of respiratory diseases.\n\r\nNana Ababio said the people had persistently appealed to the authorities at the Sunyani Municipal Assembly, but the situation remained the same, saying until something reasonable was done, the school would not be opened.\n\r\nWhen contacted, Mr. John Ansu Kumi, the Sunyani Municipal Chief Executive explained the assembly had directed contractors to water the road and help reduce the dust.\n\r\nHe said the assembly had met and interacted with opinion leaders in the town, saying academic work would resume by Monday, February 27, 2023, and advised drivers to reduce speed as well.\n\r\nMeanwhile, residents of Kuotokrom and Yawhima have expressed disgust about the delay of works on the construction of the road and appealed to the Government to intervene.\n\r\nAccording to them, contractors had abandoned works on the project and had not been seen on site for some time now.",

    "Dr Emmanuel Tinkorang, the Ashanti Regional Director of Health Services, has reiterated the need for all stakeholders to support vaccination campaigns against COVID-19. \n\r\nHe said achieving herd immunity in the fight against the global pandemic was a collective responsibility of all Ghanaians. \n\r\nHerd immunity occurs when a large portion of a community (the herd) becomes immune to a disease. The spread of disease from person to person becomes unlikely when herd immunity is achieved. As a result, the whole community becomes protected — not just those who are immune. \n\r\nSpeaking to the Ghana News Agency (GNA) ahead of another round of COVID-19 vaccination exercise, Dr Tinkorang said vaccinating a chunk of the population was the best way to reduce the risk of transmission. \n\r\nThe exercise, which is scheduled for February 20 to 24, seeks to vaccinate more people in the region with the ultimate goal of achieving herd immunity as required by the World Health Organisation (WHO). \n\r\nA total of 4,107,365 doses have so far been administered in the region with 1,682,850, representing 52.2 per cent fully vaccinated. \n\r\nWith 17.8 per cent of the eligible population left to achieve herd immunity, the Regional Health Directorate seeks to encourage about 2,381,435 people who have taken at least one dose to go for the second dose. \n\r\nThis, according to the Regional Director of Health, would help achieve the much-desired herd immunity in the interest of public health. \n\r\nHe said mobile vaccination teams would be deployed across all 43 districts to administer the vaccines and urged the public to avail themselves of the all-important national exercise. \n\r\nThey can also visit any nearby health facility for their jab not only to protect themselves but their loved ones and society at large. \n\r\nDr Tinkorang reminded those going for the second and booster doses to carry along their vaccination cards.",

He added that an aphrodisiac is anything that one takes with the intent of enjoying sexual intercourse.\n\r\n“Aphrodisiacs are beneficial when taken in the right proportion and by the right people.” Kusi Appiah, a physician specialist, noted and mentioned a few benefits such as an arousal booster, assisting in providing a relaxed mind to enjoy sexual intercourse, and also regulating the effective activity of all nerves in the reproductive system.\n\r\n“In certain cases, patrons of aphrodisiacs may perceive that an overdose of aphrodisiac may result in a better sexual experience as compared to the prescribed dosage and proceed to take it. But this is incorrect,” he said in an interview with host Sammy Eshun on The Happy Morning Show, revealing that too much of it at one time causes their system to fail to respond to the aphrodisiac effect.\n\r\n“Yes, it enhances, but it gets to a point in time whereby the natural tendency of the individual to get aroused begins to fail due to the excess intake of aphrodisiacs; what is supposed to help you progress in bed is now helping you to retrogress.” He reiterated.",

Our Concern!,” a Ghana News Agency Tema Regional Office initiative to provide a platform to explore the parameters of the four approaches to health communication- informative, educating, persuasive, and prompting.\n\r\nShe stressed that frequent use of emergency contraceptives was harmful to women with conditions classified as medical eligibility criteria (MEC) category 2, 3, or 4 for combined hormonal contraception or Progestin-only contraceptives (POC).\n\r\n“Frequent use of emergency contraception can result in increased side-effects, such as menstrual irregularities, although their repeated use poses no known health risks,” she noted.\n\r\nShe explained that just like other oral contraceptives, it worked through the increase of hormones in the body increasing the risk of users’ contracting cancers, especially breast cancer which was common in Ghana.\n\r\nShe emphasized that emergency contraceptives were meant for emergency purposes and not for everyday use, “If you are relying on emergency contraception as your main form of birth control, speak to health professionals about your options.”\n\r\nShe also encouraged young women to consider either abstaining or use of condoms as a form of protection instead of the abuse of the emergency contraceptive to avoid putting themselves at risk.\n\r\nSpeaking on the topic: “Some cancers and how to prevent them,” Dr Owusu-Afriyie explained that cancer is caused by certain changes to genes, the basic physical units of inheritance.\n\r\nShe said, “Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.”\n\r\nMr Francis Ameyibor, Tema Regional Manager of the Ghana News Agency said the “Your Health! Our Concern!” platform would provide active media advocacy channels for healthcare professionals to communicate promotional health information to disseminate public health issues and health education.\n\r\nHe said the platform was to leverage GNA’s communication expertise together with the health professional’s skills to educate the public to understand that the health of everyone matters and should therefore be the concern of all.\n\r\n“GNA- Your Health!

    "The fight against Hepatitis B infection continues as the Mumbies foundation is urging the general public to support in dealing with the viral disease.\n\r\nAs a Non-Governmental Organisation, Mumbies Foundation has for some time now contributed immensely to the fight against the deadly disease with the support of the Effutu lawmaker, Alexander Kwamena Afenyo-Markin.\n\nFinancial Support\n\r\nHowever, the quest to help deal with the disease comes with many challenges the major one being financial strength.\n\r\nIt is in line with this that the Foundation is seeking financial assistance to raise Ghc25,000.00 to help deliver on its mandate of ensuring that hepatitis B infection is minimised if not completely eradicated in the coming years.\n\r\nThe money is expected to be used for the purchase of a hepatitis B viral load testing machine, test kits and vaccines as well as to be able to offer free services to people.\n\r\nThe financial support is also targeted to save over 200 newborn babies from liver cancer and mother-to-child infections, which seems to be a major challenge in dealing with the disease.\n\r\nProject Manager for Mumbies Foundation, Israel Adorbley is, however, urging all cooperate bodies, companies as well as other bodies to come on board to raise the needed funds needed for the operations of the NGO in delivering on its mandate.\n\nGenesis of Mumbies Foundation\n\r\nThis project became necessary because, in 2019, ISRAEL ADORBLEY, a professional nurse at a rural clinic was moved by the plight of a pregnant woman in a rural community who visited the facility for ANC services. She tested positive for Hepatitis B and was unaware of her disease hence was referred to an urban hospital for management after being educated on Hepatitis B and the measures to take to prevent her baby from contracting the disease. But a few months down the lane, when met with her newborn, sadly said she was asked to purchase Hepatitis B Immune Globulin to vaccinate her newborn but couldn’t afford the COST of the immunoglobulin to vaccinate her newborn.\n\r\nThis sad incident prompted Him to seek support from the Member of Parliament of Effutu Constituency, Hon Alexander Afenyo Markin who immediately agreed to provide any needed support that will help to prevent people from becoming a victim of the disease.\n\nSurvey\n\r\nHon Alex Afenyo, the Effutu lawmaker then funded a research and sensitisation program to determine the prevalence of the disease in the Municipality. 2,106 people were tested for HBsAg across Eight (8) rural communities. Of the number, 178 representing 8.4% tested positive. These people included pregnant women, school children, the aged and the youth forming the bulk percentage with 78% testing positive. Strangely, the majority of those who tested positive were unaware of their status and were ignorant about Hepatitis B.\n\r\nThis outcome was quite shocking because with this figure if care is not taken a lot more people in the catchment area will be infected with the virus especially the newborns of the infected pregnant women are highly at risk.\r\nIt is upon this background this foundation was established to help minimize Hepatitis B spread if not eradicate the disease.\r\nOur main concern has been that mother-to-child transmission of Hepatitis B is the most common means of disease spread in endemic areas such as our place of focus for this project.\n\nCost of Treatment\n\r\nAccess to the vaccine which helps prevent mother-to-child transmission which is Hepatitis B Immune Globulin (HBIG) and Hepatitis B monovalent vaccine is a huge challenge and costly.\n\r\nMarginalized pregnant women in rural communities are not able to afford these vaccines hence exposing these innocent newborns to the risk of contracting the disease at birth. And so we wish to draw the attention of the Government, International communities, and philanthropists to deem it important and as a matter of urgency come to the aid of our cause to curb the spread of Hepatitis B in the Effutu municipality and beyond and ultimately contribute to WHO elimination target of viral Hepatitis by 2030\r\nWe believe assisting these vulnerable pregnant women to access these vaccines for their newborns to save these newborns from contracting the disease is a laudable cause to saving the future which is the motto of the foundation. Ghana is classified as one of the endemic regions of this silent worldwide pandemic with an estimated 3-4.5 million people chronically infected with the disease.\n\r\nThe causes of contracting the virus in Ghana are not different from that of the outside world such as Unprotected sex with infected people, Mother to child transmission during delivery, and contact with contaminated blood and other bodily fluids.\r\nIt is also a major contributory factor to the primary cause of liver cancer and other liver complications.\n\nGoing Forward\n\r\nMumbies Foundation since then has screened many pregnant women and many others within the Effutu municipality with the support of the Member of Parliament, Hon. Alexander Afenyo-Markin.\n\r\nThere have also been able to intensify public education for the people on the disease which seems not to be known to them as a dangerous one and needs regular attention.\n\r\nThe Winneba Central prison was not left out as officers and inmates have been screened after the foundation donated food items and toiletries to them with the support of the MP.\n\r\nOver 400 residents of Winneba were screened on 28th July 2022 during the World Hepatitis B Day celebration held globally.\n\r\nDr. Akwasi Bota, Medical Superintendent of the Effutu Municipal Hospital has emphasised the need to intensify awareness of the disease because it is more dangerous than even HIV and the other known diseases we may think of.\n\r\nHe was, however, worried that not much is been done about the disease and appealed to the government and other stakeholders to take a serious look at hepatitis B.\n\r\nHon. Afenyo-Markin, the MP for the area and deputy majority leader last week made a statement on the disease in Parliament and even called for its prioritisation.\n\r\nHe also called for discussions to enrol hepatitis B on the national health insurance scheme to enable the needy to have easy access to testing and vaccines for free as done for HIV/AIDs patients.\n\nOffice Apartment\n\r\nTo work efficiently, Mumbies Foundation has acquired an office complex at Essuekyir-Winneba to attend to all cases that may be reported to them.\n\r\nThe office complex was officially opened for operations on Friday, February 17, 2023, with the people in Effutu and beyond urged to patronise their services.\n\nAppreciation\n\r\nMr. Israel Adorbley commended Hon. Afenyo-Markin for his continuous support and commitment to the fight against the disease since 2019.\n\r\nMr. Adorbley was optimistic the MP who is also the Patron of the NGO would help facilitate the course to ensure it raises the needed amount to help in tackling the disease.",
    "The Western North Regional Office of the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) has destroyed dozens of expired and unregistered products worth GHc124,271 at Sefwi-Wiawso. \n\r\nThe items included soft and energy drinks, a variety of Aphrodisiacs, unregistered herbal products, cereals, milk, noodles, and fake schnapps.\r\nSpeaking to the Ghana News Agency after the exercise, Mr. Albert Ankamah, Western North Regional Director of the FDA, said the items were seized by the Authority during their routine market surveillance in shops in the past three months.\n\r\nHe said the seized items were mainly from the Bibiani Anhwiaso Bekwai and Wiawso Municipalities.\n\r\nMr. Ankamah pointed out that the FDA established the Western North Regional office in October 2022 and had put in place measures to ensure food safety in the Region.\n\r\nThe Regional Director used the occasion to advise consumers to be extra careful and always read the labels and to look out for the FDA registration numbers on products produced in Ghana to identify the originality of products being purchased.\n\r\nMr. Samuel Darkwah, Chief Environmental officer of Wiawso Municipal Assembly, who supervised the exercise at the Wiawso dumping site, lauded the establishment of the Food and Drugs Authority in the Region since it had ensured food safety within the Region through their supervisory duties, especially among food vendors.\n\r\nThe Senior Environmental Officer further advised retailers to check the expiry dates of all products to ensure they have the FDA-approved logo.",
    "Encasement removes hiding areas and makes it easier to spot bed bugs. This helps prevent infestations of new mattresses.\n\nTraps\n\r\nMoat-style traps may be used to isolate the bed and intercept bed bugs between their hiding places and their journey to bite the host.\n\r\nSticky pads under the legs of the bed can catch bugs, but they can be messy.\n\r\nSuch “interceptor” devices are available for purchase online, but they can also be made at home.\n\r\nScientists from the University of Florida have produced the following video, available on YouTube, explaining how to create homemade moat traps.\n\r\nPulling the bed away from the walls and ensuring that bed linen does not touch the floor helps to make the bed an island.\n\nHeat\n\r\nLaundering in hot water is an effective way of killing bed bugs on fabrics.\n\r\nBed bugs die when their body temperature is over 45° CelsiusTrusted Source or 113° Fahrenheit. Exposing the bugs for an hour to temperatures higher than these can kill all stages. At temperatures over 60°C (140°F), all bed bugs are killed rapidly.\n\r\nHeating a room is unlikely to work, because of the high temperatures needed. It may also spread an infestation, because bed bugs will seek the cooler areas in the room, beyond the reach of the heat.\n\nCold\n\r\nBed bugs can be killed by cold temperatures, but it requires temperatures below -18°C (0°F) for at least 4 days in order for the cold to penetrate an object and kill all the bugs and eggs.\n\r\nSmaller items that may contain bed bugs can be put in a suitably cold freezer and the 4-day period should be counted from when the center of the object reaches -18°C (0°F). This takes longer for bulkier objects.\n\r\nHowever, the EPA notes that home freezers may not be cold enough to kill bugs, and it can take a long time for this to work.\n\r\nGas systems designed for instant freezing are ineffective and may spread an infestation, as the high air pressure can blow the bugs away.\n\r\nTurning off the heating and leaving windows and doors open is not an effective strategy. The temperature is unlikely to be cool enough.\n\r\nLeaving a room empty for more than a year can be effectiveTrusted Source for killing bed bugs as this deprives them of sustenance.

    'Dr. Joseph Kofi Abuh, the Greater Accra Regional Veterinary Officer, says the Government will soon pay some 138 poultry farmers affected by the Avian Influenza (A-H5N1) in the region.\n\r\nHe said the Chief Veterinary Officer of the Veterinary Services Department (VSD) had approved the processed compensation certificates of the farmers and forwarded them to the Ministry of Food and Agriculture for the payments to be made.\n\r\n“These are the rest of the affected farmers yet to be compensated. Poultry farmers should be rest assured that though we are not in normal times, the government is committed to paying compensation to the rest of the affected farmers very soon,” he stated.\r\nThe first Avian Influenza case in Africa was discovered in Nigeria in early 2006.\n\r\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, Ghana suffered its first outbreak of the highly pathogenic H-5N1 bird flu at a poultry farm in Accra near the Tema Port in 2007.\n\r\nAbout 1,600 birds on the farm, mostly chickens and a few ducks were incinerated to control the spread of the disease.\n\r\nThe recent outbreak began in July 2021 when 19 out of 29 Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies had 200 farms affected. \n\r\nAdditionally, 1,024 bags of feed and 1667 crates of eggs were also destroyed. \r\nDr. Abuh said in all, about 362,934 birds were destroyed, about 255, 537 were depopulated, and 107,443 died from the virus. \n\r\nThe Veterinary Officer said efforts to find the source of the spread had been futile; he, however, attributed it to farmers neglecting biosecurity measures. \r\n‘‘Because in our visit to most of the farms, you will see that the biosecurity measures are not good.”\n\r\nBiosafety measures include good hygiene, regular disinfection of farms, and isolation and fencing of farms from human settlements.\n\r\nDr. Abuh said the poultry farmers were trained to observe strict biosecurity measures to safeguard their farms but they did not adhere to most of them.\r\nAccording to him, farmers who had failed to adhere to the biosecurity regulations would not benefit from any compensation package. \n\r\nDr. Emmanuel Kwao Pecku, the Metropolitan Veterinary Officer for Tema, advised farmers to report any suspected cases of the virus to curtail the spread.\n\r\nHe appealed for the timely allocation of resources and adequate human resources to fight the spread.\n\r\n"We were not really prepared, resources came late and we were overwhelmed by the cases since we were understaffed," Dr. Peck said.',
    "Cervical cancer has been identified as the third most common cancer in the world, and the leading cause of death in women.\n\r\nDr. Mrs. Anita Owusu-Afriyie, a medical officer at the Oncology Unit of the International Maritime Hospital (IMaH), explained that the risk of cervical cancer was higher in females, who became sexually active at an early age.\n\r\n“The high risk of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection that is persistent and ultimately leads to cervical cancer is higher in women who become sexually active before age 18 and in those who have had multiple sexual partners,” she said.\n\r\nDr. Owusu-Afriyie said this at the Ghana News Agency's public health advocacy platform in Tema, dubbed: “Your Health! Our Concern!”\n\r\nShe said though it was unfortunate that data on cervical cancer deaths in Ghana was difficult to acquire, research showed that, globally, it was one of the leading causes of death in women.\n\r\nMultiple sexual partners, and poor personal hygiene, especially surrounding the female reproductive organ, were other risk factors.\n\r\nSymptoms include brownish bloodlike discharge from the vagina, which was offensive,  bleeding after sex, and pain after sex, Dr. Owusu-Afriyie said.\n\r\nShe also touched on breast cancer and said excessive alcohol intake, age, women who had not given birth before, women who gave birth but did not breastfeed their babies, early menarche (first period), obesity and family history could be risk factors.\n\r\nEarly menarche and late menopause meant that one would be having a longer period of menstruation and periods were based on estrogen, one of the main female sex hormones.\n\r\n“The estrogens proliferate with cells such as fat cells to promote the growth of cancers and their spread,” she said.\n\r\nDr. Owusu-Afriyie said breastfeeding also helped in reducing the risk of breast cancer as that reduced the estrogen level, which gave the mother some form of protection.\n\r\nShe advised women to do regular breast screening to aid in early detection and treatment.\n\r\nMr. Francis Ameyibor, the Tema Regional Manager, GNA, said information was key to ensuring healthy lifestyles among citizens.\n\r\n“Your Health! Our Concern” platform will continue to provide health information to influence personal choices and improve health literacy in the country,” he said.",
    'Public Health Analyst, Samuel Arthur has said the Ghana Health Service (GHS) can solve the issue of no beds at health facilities resulting in fatalities when the E-bed system is revived.\n\r\nSpeaking on Starr Today with Awusi Dede on Friday, February 17, 2023, Mr. Arthur indicated that the government can solve the no-bed issue that has bedevilled the country for some time now when authorities are held accountable.   \n\r\n“I know over the years the Ghana Health Service started something that is the E-bed system which virtually was to help to have real-time information about beds that were available in facilities within certain networks. But I don’t know how far we have come with that. That was somewhere in 2017 so we are about seven years now. Where are we with the E-bed? Is it something that was piloted and abandoned? Or is it something that we felt could not help us?" Mr. Arthur asked.\n\r\nHe continued: “If not, let’s get people to come together and see how we can use technology to deal with this. If not we will have people get to the facility only to be told that there is no bed. And their only option will be to be moving from one facility to another ending up in fatalities in most cases which in most cases we can avoid, so unfortunate.”\n\nBackground\n\r\nAn eleven (11) year old girl Linda Mirekua dying from kidney disease has reportedly been denied admission at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital over the unavailability of a medical bed.\n\r\nMirekua from Nobi, a farming community in Abuakwa North Municipality has been diagnosed with kidney disease but left to die in the house due to the inability of her physically challenged poor mother to foot the cost of her dialysis.\n\r\nHer condition worsened in recent times and was admitted to Akyem Tafo Government Hospital.\n\r\nLinda’s situation was posted on a local social media platform where GHC6,000 was mobilized from contributions of philanthropists for dialysis service at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital.\n\r\nHowever, Korle Bu Teaching Hospital on Thursday, February 16, 2023, reportedly denied her admission over the unavailability of a bed.\n\r\nManagement of Akyem Tafo Hospital further contacted the University of Ghana Medical Center (UGMC) to refer Linda Mirekua but UGMC is demanding the patient to pay GHC8,000 medical bill arrears own the facility last year and be prepared for “cash and carry” before she will be admitted for the dialysis service.\n\r\nLinda Mirekua is stranded at Akyem Tafo Government hospital as her condition deteriorates.',
    "Residents of Anlo-Afiadenyigba in the Keta Municipality of the Volta region have been urged to prioritise their health issues over any other activity. \n\r\n“Your health is more important than anything else, make use of the few health facilities we have here to know your health status for healthy living.” \n\r\nDr Senanu Kwesi Djokoto, the acting Volta Regional Director of Health, made this appeal during a short fundraising ceremony at Anlo -Afiadenyigba towards the construction of a CHPS Compound in the area. \n\r\nOn the theme: “Improving Primary Healthcare, the role of community Stakeholders,” the move would further enhance quality healthcare delivery in the area. \n\r\nDr Djokoto urged the residents to get vaccinated against the Coronavirus pandemic and any other disease capable of destroying their health. \n\r\nTogbui Kadzohlo lV, the ‘Dufia’ of Anlo -Afiadenyigba, and Chairman of the event, noted that it was necessary to have additional health facilities to meet the needs of the increasing population in the area. \n\r\n“We need another health facility in addition to our Health centre at Anlo Afiadenyigba in order to reduce undue pressure on the health workers there,” he said. \n\r\nTogbui Kadzahlo lV also tasked residents living both home and abroad to show concern and play their roles as community stakeholders geared toward development. \n\r\nGilbert  Keklie, the assembly member for the area, who led the fundraising event, disclosed to the Ghana News Agency (GNA) that the community urgently needed additional health facility and pledged his full support for the project. \n\r\nHe also appealed to residents to support the laudable initiative for their own benefit.  \n\r\nA five-member committee was also formed to spearhead the contributions and donations. \n\r\nSome chiefs, health workers, assembly members, Heads of institutions and others, took part in the event.",
    "The Greater Accra Regional Chairman of the Ghana Registered Nurses and Midwives Association (GRNA), Mr. Prince Opuni Frimpong, has warned nurses and midwives who use their phones for things that do not concern their work, especially for Whatsapp, Facebook, and Tiktok during work, to put a stop to it.\n\r\nThis follows calls by some residents demanding that nurses and midwives be banned from using mobile phones while on duty.\n\r\nSome people in the Ejisu Municipality have asked the Ghana Health Service (GHS) to think about making it illegal for nurses to use cell phones at work.\n\r\nAccording to them, this will cause nurses to pay close attention while on duty and will also help save the lives of patients who require critical care and attention, particularly in emergency situations.\n\r\nThe residents made the appeal during the annual health performance review meeting organised by the municipal directorate of the GHS at Ejisu.\n\r\nThey cited several instances of nurses on duty playing games on their phones while patients who needed critical attention were left unattended to.\n\r\nThe attitude the residents claimed had led to the loss of many lives in the area and was preventing many people from accessing healthcare in government hospitals in the municipality.\n\r\nSpeaking on Atinka TV‘s morning show, Mr Prince Opuni Frimpong admitted that it was not right for nurses to use their phones unnecessarily while working.\n\r\nHowever, he also noted that most of the time, the nurses use their phones to enter data of the patients and send it to the system being used by the hospital so that the doctors and pharmacist can access the patient’s information.\n\r\nDue to that, he made the public aware that when they see the nurses on their phones, they may not be using their personal stuff that is not related to their work.\n\r\n“I want all nurses and midwives to know that our main duty is to take care of the patient, and so if there are patients who need to be attended to but you are doing WhatsApp, a call, or Facebook, which will not bring any profit to the work you are doing, or will not bring any profit to your life or the country, but it is just a game that you are playing, we have to be careful,” he said.\n\r\nHe continued, “Health workers are aware that they are not supposed to be WhatsApping, TikToking, or Facebooking when they have to attend to patients, so it will be difficult for a nurse to be on their phone playing when they have to attend to a pregnant woman who is in labour or a sick person. It will be extremely difficult for a nurse to clean a patient while Facebooking or TikToking, or for a nurse to be in the operating room taking instruments for the doctor while whacking, because that is not their training.",
    "Domoda is a type of groundnut stew found in The Gambia . Domoda is prepared using ground peanuts or peanut butter, meat, onion, tomato, garlic, seasonal vegetables, and spices. It has been described as one of the national dishes of The Gambia. \n\r\nDomoda is typically served over rice and is also sometimes served over findi , a grain that is similar to couscous in consistency. Domoda is similar to groundnut soup in Ghana and usually eaten with fufu . In this article, I examine the science behind Domoda consumption based on the main ingredient peanut.\n\nDomoda, Supporting literature\n\r\nNutrition facts\n\r\nHere are the nutrition facts for 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of raw peanuts:\n\r\nCalories: 567\r\nWater: 7%\r\nProtein: 25.8 grams\r\nCarbs: 16.1 grams\r\nSugar: 4.7 grams\r\nFiber: 8.5 grams\r\nFat: 49.2 grams\r\nSaturated: 6.28 grams\r\nMonounsaturated: 24.43 grams\r\nPolyunsaturated: 15.56 grams\r\nOmega-3: 0 grams\r\nOmega-6: 15.56 grams\r\nTrans: 0 grams\r\nFat in Domoda\n\nPeanuts are high in fat\n\r\nFour studies( Andersen et al. 1998; Rodrigues et al. 2011; Jonnala et al. 2006; B. McKevith, 2005) found that peanut has a fat content of 44–56%. However, the fat content consists mostly of mono- and polyunsaturated fat, the majority is made up of oleic and linoleic acids.\n\nProtein in Peanuts\n\r\nThey are also a good source of protein and contain about 22–30% of their total calories, which put them in a category of a good source of plant-based protein (Andersen et al. 1998; Jonnala et al. 2006; B. McKevith, 2005). Arachin and conarachin are the major proteins in peanuts and could be allergic to some people, causing life-threatening reactions(Latif et al. 2013).\n\nCarbs\n\r\nPeanuts are low in carbs .\r\nB. McKevith(2005) carb ranges from 13–16% of the total weight. The University of Sydney reports due that due to the low carbs and high protein, fat, and fiber, peanuts have a very low glycemic index (GI), which shows how quickly carbs enter your bloodstream after a meal. One study conducted in Ghana by Yeboah et al. (2019) found that the GI index of groundnut soup with beef is 4 and with anchovies is 0.9. This is very very low on the GI scale. Thus Domoda is good for diabetics.\n\nVitamins and minerals\n\r\nThe US Department of Agriculture reports that Peanuts contain so many good sources of vitamins and minerals, such as:\n\r\nBiotin- Two studies(Staggs et al. 2004; Pacheco-Alvarez et al. 2002) agreed that peanuts are loaded with biotin, significant for pregnancy.\r\nCopper- Nath R(1997) is also found in peanuts which is good for heart health.\r\nPeanuts also contain so many nutrients vital for our health. For instance, Niacin or vitamin B3, for heart disease reduction (Lavigne and Karas, 2013); Folate or vitamin B9 or folic acid, during pregnancy (Fekete et al. 2012); magnesium for heart (Guasch-Ferré et al. 2014) and many more.\n\nOther plant compounds\n\r\nPeanuts are also loaded with antioxidants. Most of these antioxidants are found in peanut skin, (Talcott et al. 2005; Lou et al. 2004).\n\r\nThis notwithstanding, peanut kernels also contain the following antioxidants:\n\r\np-Coumaric acid- is one of the major polyphenols in peanuts (Sebei et al. 2013; Talcott et al. 2005).\r\nResveratrol- reduces the risk of cancer and heart disease(Sales et al. 2014) and many others such as isoflavones, Phytosterols, and Phytic acid.\n\nTreat Erectile dysfunction\n\r\nIt may sound funny but studies support that eating peanuts may help you treat your erectile dysfunction. This is the reason. Peanuts are rich in arginine, which is an essential amino acid(Aninbon et al. 2017). Though more studies are needed. In a recent meta-analysis, Rhim et al.(2019) found that arginine has been studied extensively as a possible treatment for erectile dysfunction . one clinical trial(Stanislavov and Nikolova, 2003) oral administration of this amino acid in combination with a herbal supplement (called pycnogenol) can treat erectile dysfunction.\n\r\nMore studies supported peanuts on male sexual functions. For instance, (Arya et al. 2016; Ghimire et al. 2017) found that nitric oxide converted is a compound that helps dilate the blood vessels to improve blood flow and circulation.\n\r\nTwo more studies (Davies KP, 2016; Rhim et al. 2019) found that arginine supplements may help treat mild to moderate erectile dysfunction.\n\r\nTest-tube and animal studies(Chen et al. 2017; Jia et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2019; Abbaspour et al. 2019) have found that arginine could improve semen quality, enhance libido, and increase testosterone levels. A previous study(Arya et al. 2016) reported that resveratrol in peanuts, an antioxidant supports sexual health in men.\n\r\nFinally, other animal and human studies(Bahmanzadeh et al. 2019; Illiano et al. 2020; Sener et al. 2018; Bai and An R, 2015) found that resveratrol could improve sperm quality and erectile function.\n\r\nHence, eating Domoda or groundnut could be helping you deal with your erectile and sexual functions. So men it appears Domoda or peanut soup is our friend to explore to keep our sex life in good health.\n\nMay Boost Energy\n\r\nOne study by Bonku and Yu, (2020) notes that Peanuts are a rich source of protein and fiber that assists in the conversion of carbohydrates into energy. An old study by (Jett C. 1953) established that the protein in peanuts is around 25% of the total calories. These combinations; of fiber and protein slow down the digestive process to facilitate a steady release of energy into the body. Eva De Angelis , Dietitian Nutritionist, says, “Likewise, their nutrient profile makes them superb pre-workout snacks, especially peanut butter with no added sugar, salt, or oils, which is easier to eat.”\n\r\nAnother study looks at the effect of peanuts on muscle(Carbone and Pasiakos, 2019) and found that it increases strength and supports muscle growth, especially when paired with resistance training.\n\r\nAnother randomized controlled trial(Lamb et al. 2020) report that taking a peanut powder supplement increased muscle mass and strength among older adults when combined with resistance training.\n\nWeight loss\n\r\nOne major area of research is on weight loss though you would assume that being high in fat and calories, could contribute to weight gain. But this is not the case. It rather increases weight loss(Ogden et al. 2010). Four observational studies(Moreno et al. 2013; Mattes et al. 2008; Bes-Rastrollo et al. 2009; Hu and Stampfer, 1999) found that peanut consumption may help maintain a healthy weight and reduce the risk of obesity. It is however prudent to take note that, the studies are only observational, they cannot prove causation.\n\r\nThis notwithstanding, one small clinical trial in 16 women conducted in 6 months found that when other sources of fat in a low-fat diet were replaced with peanuts, they lost 6.6 pounds (3 kg) despite being told to maintain their initial weight(O'Byrne et al. 1997).\n\r\nAnother study found that when 3 ounces (89 grams) of peanuts were added to the daily diet of healthy adults for 8 weeks, they did not gain as much weight as expected(Alper and Mattes, 2002). Finally, Arya et al. (2016) study found that the consumption of peanuts and peanut butter can increase feelings of fullness. These could satisfy individuals better than carbohydrate-filled snacks in equal quantities.\n\nHeart Health\n\r\nSome observational studies (Hu and Stampfer, 1999; Hu et al. 1998; Li et al. 2009) found that eating peanuts, as well as other types of nuts, may protect against heart disease.\n\r\nThese protective effects could be due to many reasons, (Kris-Etherton et al. 2008; Ros E. 2008; Alper and Mattes, 2003).\n\r\nA recent study, by Hong et al.( 2018) conducted on rats also stated that polyphenol-rich peanut skin extract may reduce the inflammation that causes heart disease. A more recent study that seems to place peanuts on the scale with red wine attests that the resveratrol in peanuts has antioxidant properties that may help combat heart disease. That is why peanuts seem to have similar cardioprotective effects as other foods containing resveratrol (Dyck et al. 2019). Finally, a study on rats conducted by Marmara University (Turkey) found that peanuts increase the levels of good cholesterol(Emekli-Alturfan and Kasikci, 2007). Though more studies are needed.\n\nGallstone prevention\n\r\nTwo observational studies(Tsai et al. 2004; Tsai et al. 2004) found that frequent peanut consumption may cut the risk of gallstones in both men and women.\n\nBlood sugar control\n\r\nAdding peanuts or peanut butter to a meal does not spike blood sugar levels. Having them along with a meal high in GL (like a bagel or a glass of juice) may stabilize your blood sugar levels. Peanuts have a GI (glycemic index) score of 14. While the GI of peanuts is 14 (on a 100-point scale), their GL (glycemic load, which tells what a particular food will do to your sugar levels) is just 1(Arya et al. 2016).\n\r\nThat is why the American Diabetes Association names peanuts as a diabetes superfood. What makes it a superfood is that in a soup form even when combined with beef has a GI of 7, and anchovies have a GI of 0.7(Yeboah et al. 2019). This is why we have to eat our local foods as Africans.\n\r\nThe fiber in peanuts also helps lower blood sugar levels . They also contain magnesium and other healthy oils that play a role in this aspect(Arya et al. 2016).\n\r\nAnother randomized controlled trial conducted by Reis et al. (2013) at the Federal University Of Vicoça (Brazil) on obese women found that consuming peanuts or peanut butter right in the morning may control blood sugar levels throughout the day.\n\r\nA previous study by (Jiang et al. 2002) conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that a higher intake of peanuts and peanut butter can help reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in women. Finally, another randomized controlled trial by Wien et al.(2014)\n\r\nFound that daily consumption of a diet enriched with peanuts over 24 weeks could improve health parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes. The rich nutritional profile of peanuts responsible for this, which includes monounsaturated fat, fiber, arginine, niacin, folate, and vitamin E. Is this not interesting for diabetics to eat Domoda or groundnut soup and its related product?\n\nMay Reduce Cancer Risk\n\r\nLee et al. (2018) study found that high consumption of peanuts (including other nuts) has been associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. The isoflavonesi , resveratrol, and phenolic acid found in peanuts have anti-cancer properties which may help reduce the risk of cancer.\n\r\nAnother study conducted in The Netherlands by Brandt et al.(2018) found that peanut consumption is linked with a reduced risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. Peanuts were also found to prevent gastric and esophageal cancers among older American adults. Hashemian et al. (2017) went further and compared those who take peanut butter and those who did not and found that those who did not consume any nuts or peanut butter were at the highest risk of developing these cancers.\n\r\nThough some concerns have been raised concerning peanuts and cancer by the National Cancer Institute(2022) because Peanuts might be contaminated with aflatoxins, a family of toxins produced by certain fungi as they may increase the risk of liver cancer. However, a Sales et al.(2014) study conducted by the University of Georgia (USA) found that the resveratrol found in peanuts possesses potent antioxidant properties that help in reducing the risk of cancer.\n\nOther emerging interests\n\r\nFirst, Morris et al.(2004) study found that diets that are rich in niacin – like peanuts – may protect against Alzheimer’s disease and age-related cognitive decline. Peanuts are an excellent source of niacin and vitamin E, both of which have been shown to protect against Alzheimer’s disease. Another study by Arya et al.(2016) conducted on 4000 people aged 65 years and older found that niacin from food slows down the rate of cognitive decline.\n\r\nSecond, Douglas et al.(2006) report that anecdotal evidence suggests that peanuts may help treat Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) as they contain monounsaturated fats. Some research states that a diet high in these fats could help improve the metabolic profile of women with PCOS.\n\r\nThird, as per anecdotal evidence(stylecraze.com), peanut consumption may protect your skin from sunburn and damage. The vitamin E, magnesium, and zinc found in peanuts may fight bacteria and make your skin glow. Beta-carotenei , an antioxidant available in peanuts, may help also improve skin health.\n\r\nFinally, Goluch-Koniuszy(2016) found that peanuts contain all the amino acids and lots of protein, so they may be a good supplement to a diet for hair growth\n\nPeanuts, concerns\n\nAflatoxin\n\r\nWild and Gong(2009) study found aflatoxins to be a major issue that can trigger liver cancer in peanuts. The aflatoxin concern is dependent on peanuts are stored. The risk increases with warm and humid conditions, especially in the tropics. The study however found that the aflatoxin contamination can be effectively prevented by properly drying peanuts after harvesting and keeping temperature and humidity low during storage.\n\r\nAlso, another concern is the phytic acid content in peanuts. Phytic acid (phytate) is found in all edible seeds, nuts, grains, and legumes. In peanuts, it ranges from 0.2–4.5% (Schlemmer et al. 2009). Phytic acid reduces the availability of iron and zinc in peanuts, lowering their nutritional value a little(Lopez et al. 2002). This notwithstanding, Atli Arnarson(2019) notes that this is usually not a concern in well-balanced diets and among those who eat meat regularly. He notes: “Nonetheless, it may be a problem in developing countries where the main food sources are grains or legumes.” Finally, some also experienced allergies to eating peanuts (Burks AW, 2008).\n\nTake Home\n\r\nIn conclusion, it appears men in particular stand to benefit more from eating peanuts related to diet in any form such as Domoda, groundnut soup, peanut paste, and many more. Some of the benefits are: promoting muscle growth, supporting heart health, improving sperm quality, and enhancing sexual function. I know the men will start advising their wives to prepare them Domoda or groundnut soup. Don’t you think Africa is blessed?\n\r\nEnjoy!\n\nNB:\n\r\nProf. Nyarkotey has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical associations to justify his write-ups.

    "An eleven(11) year old girl Linda Mirekua dying from kidney disease has reportedly been denied admission at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital over the unavailability of a medical bed.\n\r\nMirekua from Nobi, a farming community in Abuakwa North Municipality has been diagnosed of kidney disease but left to die in the house due to the inability of her physically challenged poor mother to foot the cost of her dialysis.\n\r\nHer condition worsened in recent times and was admitted at the Akyem Tafo Government Hospital.\n\r\nLinda’s situation was posted on a local social media platform where Ghc6,000 was mobilized from contribution of philanthropists for dialysis service at Korle Bu Teaching Hospital.\n\r\nHowever, Korle Bu Teaching Hospital on Wednesday, February 16, 2023, reportedly denied her admission over the unavailability of a bed.\n\r\nManagement of Akyem Tafo Hospital further contacted University of Ghana Medical Center (UGMC) to refer Linda Mirekua but UGMC is demanding the patient to pay Ghc8,000 medical bill arrears owed the facility last year and be prepared for “cash and carry” before she will be admitted for the dialysis service.\n\r\nLinda Mirekua is stranded at Akyem Tafo Government hospital as her condition deteriorates.\n\r\nNurses at the hospital have been contributing to support her feeding and other needs.\n\r\nAn Assembly Member William Kofi Afari Agyemang, fronting mobilization of financial contributions to support the little girl told Starr News “she was supposed to go Accra yesterday for her dialysis after mobilizing about GHC 6000 for her. The health officer at the Tafo hospital made some calls to get bed available before she is transported. The first call was made to Korle bu teaching hospital and we were told there is no bed to admit her for her case for now”.\n\r\nHe continued: ” Second call went to Legon UGMC where they told us Little Linda is owing the facility Ghc8,000 so they have to pay those arrears and should prepare for cash down service before she will be admitted. But now the money we have been able to mobilize is Ghc6,000 which cannot even settle the arrears at UGMC.So in short Linda is still at the Tafo hospital where we are managing the situation till we get a green light from Korle Bu teaching hospital. We are still calling on Philanthropists to support us”.\n\r\nAccording to Medical Doctors, the most common causes of kidney disease in children are: kidney birth defects, genetic diseases, Kidney infection, nephrotic syndrome, systemic diseases Kidney trauma or injury problems with the urinary system.\n\r\nLinda’s ailment almost truncated her education.\n\nYou can also watch this episode of People & Places here:",
    "Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies have been urged to timeously release funds allotted for immunisation and in the right amount. \n\r\nThey have also been urged to incorporate immunisation financing into their plans and budget to ensure that they are committed to and intentional about efficient immunisation service delivery to protect children. \n\r\nThese formed part of the recommendations of a study on immunisation budget credibility, which was released at a zonal stakeholders’ dialogue in Tamale. \n\r\nStakeholders including district directors of health, representatives from MMDAs and Regional Coordinating Councils and Regional Health Directorates from the northern sector attended the forum to discuss the study and the way forward in addressing the gaps identified by the study. \n\r\nSEND GHANA, a civil society organisation, with funding support from the United Nations Children’s Fund, and the International Budget Partnership undertook the study in 2022 in five selected MMDAs including Asuogyaman, Ho, Shia Osudoku, Tatali-Sangule, and Kassena Nankana to assess the financial or budgetary commitments for immunisation at the national and MMDAs levels. \n\r\nAmongst the findings of the study was the inadequate and late release of funds towards immunisation by MMDAs, which impeded the implementation of immunisation outreach service delivery to meet timelines and targets given that immunisation services were time-bound. \n\r\nThe study argued that the implication of the inadequate and late release of funds was that some children, who needed immunisation, might not be reached with all the required vaccines, a situation, which would affect the health of the future generation. \n\r\nThe study called on the Ministry of Finance to have a separate budget line for allocation to immunisation in the national health budget and encourage MMDAs to do the same to help ensure easy tracking of immunisation expenditure. \n\r\nStakeholders acknowledged that there was poor funding and late release of funds towards immunisation activities and expressed the need for MMDAs and District Health Management Teams to deepen collaboration to share their priorities on time to see how best to prioritise resources towards immunisation to protect children. \n\r\nHaruna Mahamud, Northern Regional Budget Officer said a lot more needed to be done by MMDAs to improve allocation towards immunisation expressing the need for the MMDAs to step up their efforts at improving the situation. \n\r\nMumuni Mohammed, Regional Programme Manager of SEND GHANA urged MMDAs to prioritise issues of immunisation and take relevant steps to not only budget for immunisation but to also release the funds on time to adequately prosecute immunisation activities.",
    'The Chief Executive Officer of the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA), Dr. Bernard Okoe Boye, has said that the NHIA is adopting a Value-Based Care system to address some of the challenges in healthcare delivery in Ghana.\n\r\nAccording to the NHIA CEO, the Value-Based Care (VBC) system, when successfully implemented, will provide all citizens with quality and equitable access to basic healthcare.\n\r\nHe made these comments at the opening of a 5-day workshop in Accra organized by the PharmAccess Foundation in Ghana in partnership with Leapfrog to Value and the Christian Health Association of Ghana.\n\r\nAccording to him, data analytics, and digitalization of the NHIA system will be key to the implementation of Value-Based Care.\n\r\nThe NHIA has in recent years deployed digital technologies to enhance the provision of healthcare in Ghana. Among these technologies are the mobile NHIS renewal system which helps subscribers to renew and pay their insurance premiums in a convenient way, and the digital claims submission, CLAIM-IT application, which helps providers to submit their claims without hassle. \n\r\nDr. Bernard Okoe Boye said the digitalization of these processes has enabled the NHIA to analyze and visualize its data to aid decision-making for improving the sustainability of the scheme. \n\r\n"Well, I am excited because you can have so much data, but if you don’t sit down to look at the data, you might not profit from the data. A few years ago, 80% of our claims management process was manual. People were forced to sit by papers to assist, and so on. It was not efficient. As we speak, approximately 75% of the process is now electronic."\n\r\nHe said these digitalized processes are the spade works that will ensure the authority’s digital transformation in managing providers and subscribers.\n\r\n“These digitalized processes allow us to consolidate all the information we have about Ghanaians who attend hospitals." He said.\n\r\nHe revealed that careful analysis of claims using technology has enabled the authority gain insights into the disease patterns of subscribers and the cost of care for these diseases over time. \n\r\nSpeaking of Value-Based Care, he mentioned that it makes provision for investing in preventive interventions that improve the health of the population. "VBC will tell you where to push your resources, so that you have the best outcome, and that is what we are here to do," Dr. Okoe Boye said.\n\r\nDr. Okoe Boye added that the VBC will be a component of the NHIA\'s quality strategy to reform how healthcare is delivered and paid for in Ghana.\n\r\nHe acknowledged that the current system is a drain on the government\'s limited resources and that a rethinking of the current system will help contain the escalating payments in government claims. He further appealed for expedited action in the implementation of a value-based care system.\n\r\nThe NHIA will pilot VBC with its partners PharmAccess Foundation, Leapfrog to Value, and the Christian Health Association of Ghana (CHAG). The model is centered on patients, and it guarantees efficient use and allocation of resources, ensures quality, and improves health outcomes. \n\r\nFor his part, the Executive Director of the Christian Health Association of Ghana, (CHAG) Dr. Peter Yeboah said the current challenges in health insurance administration have magnified the need for VBC. \n\r\nThe new model, according to Dr. Yeboah, will reduce the burden on the scheme when it comes to paying claims. He said the current National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) rewards the volume of healthcare delivered rather than the quality of service.\n\r\nDr. Yeboah further noted that “the central goal of any health system is to provide optimal health outcomes – first, to individuals and, second, to ensure societal wellbeing at all levels. And therefore, the value-based Care concept is about the way healthcare is supposed to be organized, delivered, and paid for.\r\n In other words, rather than the volume of services, it is the focus on the value, the health that could be gained from the resources available to the entire health sector."\n\r\nHe emphasized that the VBC will ensure optimal clinical outcomes for clients within the entire health system, while deepening efficiency gains via cost containment," he added.\n\r\nThe NHIA and its partners PharmAccess Foundation, Leapfrog to Value, and the Christian Health Association of Ghana have begun work on a human-centered design for piloting. \n\r\nThe design will include parameters for the selection of a care pathway, measurement, delivery, and payments as well as incentive criteria for the value-based Care to be piloted in Ghana. The pilot is expected to assist critical decision-making as well as policy formulation in a bid to improve healthcare delivery in Ghana.\n\r\nThe NHIA CEO commended PharmAccess Foundation for leading the way with digital technologies to improve healthcare delivery in Ghana. \n\r\nAlso at the event, Operations Manager at PharmAccess Foundation in Ghana, Dr. Gifty Sunkwa-Mills, said the Value-Based Care model, when implemented, will provide transparency for providers into outcomes and cost data. \n\r\n“We are aligning patients, payers, and providers to ensure that we deliver the best quality of care at the most efficient cost. So, it’s a model where we measure outcomes, deliver, and then pay for the healthcare using a cost-efficient approach, while focusing on clinical outcomes, quality of care and client experience of care" Dr. Gifty Sunkwa-Mills added.',
    "The National Leprosy Central Programme (NLCP) of the Ghana Health Service (GHS) has revealed a trend of new cases of leprosy among children in the country.\n\r\nThe NLCP stated in an article published in the Wednesday, February 15, 2023 edition of the Ghanaian Times Newspaper that over the last five years, at least 200 new cases of leprosy have been recorded in the country each year.\n\r\nThe NLCP further indicates that, as of September last year, 221 new cases of leprosy had been reported, of which seven involved children. Also, all 16 regions of Ghana were endemic for leprosy, although the Upper East and Upper West regions reported the highest number of new cases annually.\n\r\nCited in the article, the Programmes Manager of NLCP, Dr. Benedict OkoeQuao, is quoted as saying that,\n\r\n“This tells us that transmission is ongoing and we are all at risk. The only luck is that a lot of us have strong immunity and our body naturally fights the organism; else we would have had a huge problem on our hands,” he said.\n\r\nAccording to him, the risk of spread among the population has resulted in the revision of the Programme control strategy, which further aligns with the World Health Organization (WHO) vision to ensure that countries all over the world declare “Zero Leprosy” by 2030.\n\r\n“Therefore, in line with the new NTD roadmap, 2021-2030, the international health organization targets that in the next seven years, there will be zero-leprosy infection, zero disability and zero-stigma and discrimination associated with persons diagnosed with leprosy,” he noted.\n\r\nWhile these objectives are achievable, Dr. Quao, admitted that stigma and discrimination against persons diagnosed or suffering from the effects of leprosy could be the greatest hurdle to overcome.\n\r\nHe said a lot of cruelty meted out to patients are based on myths, misconceptions and low public knowledge about the disease.\n\r\n“For instance, hugging someone cured of leprosy won’t make you get it. Most of the people with disability, especially, the clawed fingers and toes are cured. They don’t have the disease but the claws is a disability and may remain,” he explained.\n\r\nHe, therefore, stressed on the need for extensive public health interventions about the disease, emphasizing that, presently, there is a need for the establishment of the Public Health Emergency Fund (PHEF), which could help provide sustainable investment and funding into leprosy interventions.\n\r\n“Currently, we have funding to administer rifampicin in only six regions and that is from foreign donor organizations. If you suspect a case now, you need to send in logistics to do tracing, among other investigations. But at whose cost?” he questioned.\n\r\nHe added, “If we have a dedicated fund where the or Ghanaians could contribute to regularly, we could tap into it to implement preventive measures against such public threats.”\n\r\nPI/WA",
    "Vaccines are powerful public health tools, but they’re only as good as their reach. And traditionally, people with means who live closer to cities access them more easily than others.\n\r\nBut leaders in Ghana and other countries are challenging that norm. In 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic upended the world, the Government of Ghana partnered with Zipline to deliver medical supplies, including vaccines, from local distribution centers directly to health facilities through a network of autonomous drones.\n\r\nThree years later, Zipline has delivered nearly 8 million doses of routine and COVID-19 vaccines in Ghana. And early research suggests this partnership is transforming public health in ways neither Zipline nor the Government predicted.\n\r\nIt turns out that better vaccine access creates a ripple effect. Vaccines prevent deadly diseases, but they do much more. They open the door to better health in ways that we’re only learning by changing access expectations. \n\nPreventing missed opportunities\n\r\nImagine a woman, a farmer, who lives in the North East Region of Ghana, next to the Burkinabe border. She has two children, a newborn and a two-year-old. Her baby is sick, so she stops farming early to walk with both children several hours to the hospital in Walewale.\n\r\nThey wait in the heat for half the day to see the doctor. During the visit, the doctor realizes the baby hasn’t started its series of tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccines.\n\r\nThis is a crucial moment for the family's health, and it hinges on the contents of the hospital’s refrigerator. Here, one of two things can happen.\n\r\nFirst, the hospital has the DTaP vaccine cocktail in stock and the doctor gives the child a shot. In the second scenario, the hospital is stocked out, which means the doctor will treat the baby, then refer the mother to another clinic to start the vaccine series or tell her to return when the hospital has the vaccine.\n\r\nFrom a public health standpoint, the second scenario is catastrophic, according to Pedro Kremer, Head of Global Health Impact at Zipline. “In remote areas, when someone reaches a health facility there’s an opportunity to vaccinate,” he says. “If the vaccine is stocked out, that person will go home and may not make contact with the health system again for years. We call that a missed opportunity, and it is a serious public health problem.”\n\r\nA missed opportunity means the baby may never receive routine vaccines, putting it at risk of contracting or spreading life-threatening diseases. Children with whooping cough, or pertussis, a bacterial infection that can cause flu-like symptoms in children and respiratory damage in babies, spread the disease to an average of 15-17 other people in unvaccinated communities.\n\r\nTo prevent this, the Government of Ghana partnered with Zipline to increase the reach of its vaccine distribution program. During the official program launch in 2019, Vice President Alhaji Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia declared it a “major step towards giving everyone in this country universal access to lifesaving medicines.” At that point, Zipline had already built the largest autonomous delivery network in the world, having flown more than 11,800 deliveries in Rwanda, where it launched in 2016.\n\r\nZipline had spent three years in Rwanda solving the last-mile problem for medical products, such as blood, that need to stay cold. Zipline’s two distribution centers stored refrigerated blood that had been processed by the Rwanda Biomedical Center. Doctors and nurses then ordered the blood they needed for resupplies or emergencies, and a Zipline drone delivered the chilled blood within 45 minutes.\n\r\nThe Government of Ghana wanted to take the on-demand cold-chain model Zipline developed for blood and apply it to medical products including vaccines.\r\nGhana’s program launched with four Zipline distribution centers that could reach more than 2,000 hospitals and health centers across the country. \n\r\nBy the beginning of March 2020, the program was growing steadily. Zipline was delivering several hundred doses of routine vaccines per month.\n\r\nThen, on March 22, 2020, President Nana Akufo-Addo issued the order to close Ghanaian borders to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, initiating a national lockdown. Still, a year out from the first COVID-19 vaccine, Ghana’s system for delivering routine, life-saving vaccines hit a wall.\n\r\nBefore Zipline, Ghana’s system required health workers, particularly those in the hard-to-reach communities,  to drive to a regional cold room, put vaccine doses in a cold box, and transport them to a health center.\n\r\nAlso, at the time, 15 of Ghana’s 216 districts across the country lacked the cold-chain equipment they needed. And seven out of Ghana’s 16 regions hadn’t installed walk-in cold rooms.\n\r\nThis meant Zipline’s ability to ship vaccines while protecting workers’ health mattered more than ever.\n\nGhana’s COVID-19 response\n\r\nDuring the pandemic, orders for Zipline vaccine deliveries skyrocketed. Demand grew from about 800 doses per month in March 2020 to more than 9,000 per month in November of that year. In November 2022, Zipline delivered 430,174 total vaccines from six distribution centers across the country.\n\r\n“Before the pandemic, the Ghana Health Service and Zipline spent two years bringing innovative new technology to the national vaccine distribution system in Ghana,” said Dr. Anthony Nsiah-Asare, the Presidential Advisor on Health to the President of Ghana; formerly the Director General of Ghana Health Service. “Which means that when the first vaccines against COVID-19 were approved, we were ready.”  \n\r\nIn April 2020, global organizations UNICEF, the World Health Organization, GAVI, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations formed an alliance called COVAX to ensure countries all over the world could access COVID-19 vaccines.\n\r\nOn February 24, 2021, Ghana received its first shipment of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX. Less than a week later, Zipline made its first delivery of the vaccine to a health center in Ghana’s Ashanti Region.\n\r\nIn parallel, Zipline was working with both the UPS Foundation and Pfizer to fly COVID-19 vaccines in Ghana. In December 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration granted Pfizer the right to distribute its COVID-19 mRNA vaccine under emergency use authorization.\n\r\nBefore Zipline could transport it, Pfizer had to validate that the vaccine would stay cold and viable through the last mile of delivery. At the time, Pfizer’s mRNA product was designated an Ultra Low-Temperature vaccine, meaning it needed to be frozen at -76 degrees Fahrenheit, at the warmest. Once thawed, it could be refrigerated for 30 days and had to be used within five hours after it was brought to room temperature and prepared. \n\r\nIn November 2021 Pfizer greenlighted Zipline’s supply chain – from a facility in Belgium to storage in an ultra-cold freezer at a Zipline hub to being cold-packed in a box to, finally, that box dropping out of a drone in a parachute at a health facility in Ghana. At the time, Zipline had delivered more than 220,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from multiple manufacturers.\n\r\nBut Pfizer’s validation made it possible for an entirely new population to benefit from mRNA vaccine technology. “The freezing and refrigeration process meant that before Zipline, rural areas had almost no chance of getting these vaccines,” says Caitlin Burton, Vice President of Global Partnerships at Zipline. “But we had six distribution centers that could store these ultra-cold mRNA vaccines. We could reach millions of Ghanaians and serve even the hardest-to-reach areas.”\n\r\nToday, the Government of Ghana has delivered more than 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Out of those, Zipline has flown more than 2 million via drone.\n\r\nThough ten percent of the country’s vaccine deliveries, those 2 million doses have disproportionately reached vulnerable families. The majority of the vaccines Zipline delivered in Ghana went to districts with a high proportion of households led by women, rural districts, and districts where people have limited access to safe water. \n\r\nMore than a third of vaccines were delivered within a month of expiring and would have been destroyed in other countries without a system to distribute them before the end of their shelf life.\n\r\n“The bottom line is that we are not only delivering high volumes on time, but we are also reaching those who need vaccines the most,” Kremer says. “This means we are both increasing access and reducing health inequalities.”\n\r\nIn areas, Zipline serves, Ghana has seen vaccination rates increase by 21 percentage points, on average, across all vaccines in the routine childhood immunization schedule. This is amid what the World Health Organization calls the “largest continued to backslide in vaccinations in three decades.”\n\r\nAlso, Ghanaian health facilities served only by Zipline cut the duration of stockouts by 60%, on average, compared to those that received supplies from other sources, according to research conducted by global analytics firm IDinsight and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Zipline-served facilities also had a 42% reduction in missed opportunities for vaccination compared to other facilities.\n\r\nIn other words, Zipline has helped the Ghanaian government turbocharge its vaccine distribution system. By improving access and reducing missed opportunities, Zipline vaccine deliveries in Ghana have potentially saved the lives of more than 700 children, according to a new study led by Kremer, who will publish this and other results in a peer-reviewed journal this year.\n\r\nWhat’s more, collaborative research from Kremer’s team and health officials at Ghana's Western North Region Health Directorate indicates that the health benefits of Zipline’s vaccination program extended beyond the preventive power of vaccines.\n\nOpening the door to better public health\n\r\nZipline’s GH4 hub in Sefwi Wiawso sits between the city of Kumasi and Ghana’s western border with Côte d'Ivoire, one of the country’s most difficult areas to reach with essential medical supplies. While looking at the data around vaccination coverage for GH4, Kremer found something interesting.\n\r\n“We found that children treated at facilities served by our GH4 hub had fewer episodes of diarrhea compared to control groups.” Kremer said, “But the reduction was independent of the increase in vaccination coverage for the disease.”\n\r\nKremer says one potential explanation is that once people know a facility is served by Zipline, they trust that the treatments they need will be there, so they’re more likely to go at all. “Maybe they go for a vaccination or a specific condition, and a provider is able to talk about safe water, disease prevention, and other health issues – then you start seeing better outcomes,” Kremer says. \n\r\n“If the supply chain is working, it triggers more trust in the system. More trust translates into more consultations and better health results.”  \r\nIn the coming year, Zipline intends to scale its success in Ghana by bringing vaccination programs to new countries. Since launching in September 2022, Zipline has delivered more than 300,000 doses of vaccines from its hub in Kaduna State in Nigeria, an area with one of the country’s highest rates of zero-dose children.\n\r\n“We’ve seen evidence that Zipline can help us address one of the most significant public health challenges on the planet: Reaching children who have never received life-saving vaccines,” says Moz Siddiqui, Head of Private Sector Partnerships & Innovation at GAVI. “We are helping people access known treatments for deadly diseases. In many cases, we know the science – now we’re working to solve the access problem.”  \n\r\nVaccination is medically simple – it takes seconds. But the system behind getting a high-quality vaccine to a facility and into the arm of a person can be complex.\n\r\nZipline wants to change that. In the next several years, working with governments and international partners, Zipline’s delivery platform could make it easy for more health centers across the world to stock vaccines.\n\r\nThat means when mothers walk miles with their children and doctors see an opportunity to prevent life-threatening diseases, they can. It means as Zipline vaccination programs expand in Ghana, Nigeria, and other countries, these crucial, snapshot public health interactions move from catastrophic to preventive. \n\r\nIt means that healthcare workers will have more of the resources they need to prevent disease and earn the trust of their patients. Most importantly, it means fewer people will get sick and die because of where they live and what happens to be in the refrigerator at the hospital when they need care.\n\r\nVaccines are powerful tools for public health. And now, Zipline and partners are creating a supply chain that changes who can get them and when allowing government and public health leaders to fully tap into their power.\r\n\u200d",
    "In 2019, the World Health Organisation stated that an estimated 820,000 people died from liver cancer induced by Hepatitis B.\n\r\nDescribed as one of the most silent killers in medical circles, the deadly disease has continued to devastate nations and cripple many families.\n\r\nAnd that was the concern of the Deputy Majority Leader in Parliament, Alexander Kwamena Afenyo-Markin, when he addressed the House on Tuesday, February 14, 2023.\n\r\nPainting a worrying picture of how the disease continues to destroy many lives across the world, the deputy leader, who is also the Member of Parliament for Effutu, called for urgent attention to be given to it, ensuring that it is tackled from the roots.\n\r\nHe stressed that it should be a matter of grave concern, particularly because many people living with the disease are not even aware of it.\n\r\n“This situation is not only unfortunate but troubling. Indeed, the problem around the country is equally frightening. It is estimated that the national prevalence of chronic Hepatitis B virus stood somewhere between 8.36% (in 2020) and 12.30% (in 2016).\n\r\n“On the whole, some 3 to 4.6 million people are said to be suffering from chronic Hepatitis B infection in Ghana. Unfortunately, the majority of those living with the virus do not know their status. This is the case even though science and medicine have developed to a point where it is possible to eliminate the virus,” he said.\n\r\nIn the breakdown, the WHO estimates that “approximately two people die each minute from hepatitis B—this translates to one person every 30 seconds.”\n\nThe Ghana situation:\n\r\nExpanding his statements on the subject with statistics from his constituency, Effutu, Alexander Afenyo-Markin said that the Hepatitis B story in Ghana is a ‘troubling’ one.\n\r\nWith as many as 4.6 million Ghanaians suffering from the chronic disease, he stated that not even advancements in science and medicine have helped much.\n\r\n“The situation in Ghana is equally dire. For example, in my constituency, Effutu, a survey I commissioned in 2019 showed the prevalence rate of the virus at 8.5 percent. This situation is not only unfortunate but also troubling.\n\r\n“Indeed, the problem around the country is equally frightening. It is estimated that the national prevalence of chronic Hepatitis B virus stood somewhere between 8.36% (in 2020) and 12.30% (in 2016). On the whole, some 3 to 4.6 million people are said to be suffering from chronic Hepatitis B infection in Ghana.\n\r\n“Unfortunately, the majority of those living with the virus do not know their status. This is the case even though science and medicine have developed to a point where it is possible to eliminate the virus,” he added.\n\r\nBesides, the Coalition for Global Hepatitis B Elimination has painted a further worrying picture for the country.\n\r\nAccording to the MP, the Coalition paints a gloomy picture for Ghana, as it has no national elimination plan for the disease in the country.\n\r\n“Unfortunately, the Coalition for Global Hepatitis B Elimination suggests that Ghana does not presently have a national Hepatitis B (HBV) or C (HCV) elimination plan. Although the country released the Ghana National Policy on Viral Hepatitis, this was before the WHO elimination goals came into force,” he added.\n\r\nHe also raised concerns about the fact that in Ghana, just as in other low-income countries, most people with liver cancer, which is induced by Hepatitis B, die early because they don’t receive early detection of the disease.\n\r\nBut even more scary are the estimates that were released by the Ghana Health Service for the year 2020.\n\r\nAccording to the statement read by the MP, the GHS believes that newborns, numbering up to 120,000, are at high risk of being exposed to Hepatitis B.\n\r\nThe report added that even more concerning is the fact that, should this trend of disease infections not be curtailed, only 10% of newborns may be free from not eventually contracting the deadly disease.\n\r\n“Indeed, estimates released by the Ghana Health Service in 2020 show that an average of 120,000 newborns will be exposed to the Hepatitis B virus by their mothers during delivery. Also, up to 90% of Ghana's newborns may end up being infected at some point,” he added.\n\nWhat Ghana should do:\n\r\nAlthough the situation in Ghana appears dire, the Deputy Majority Leader, Alexander Kwamena Afenyo-Markin, however, believes that it can be tackled head-on.\n\r\nHe believes, however, that if some urgent measures are put in place, Hepatitis B can be promptly dealt with in the country.\n\r\nThe Deputy Majority Leader outlined some three major pointers that he believes will get this plan properly underway.\n\r\nThe most important of them, he stated, should be that the testing and treatment of Hepatitis B and its related conditions should be included in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS).\n\r\n1. “Firstly, Mr Speaker, Ghana must prioritise and scale up Hepatitis B elimination prevention, testing and treatment programs to ensure that no one is left behind.\n\r\n“Experts say that the most potent means of stopping mother-to-child transmission include the use of Hepatitis B Immunoglobulin (HBIG) and vaccination with a birth dose of the Hepatitis B vaccine. It seems that these interventions are yet to be deployed in Ghana.\n\r\n2. “Secondly, Ghana must take a bold decision to make viral Hepatitis B prevention, vaccination, testing and treatment part of the package of services for Universal Health Coverage (UHC) programs. In short, the NHIS should bear the cost of testing and treating Hepatitis B cases in the country.\n\r\n“This approach is vital because most citizens, particularly pregnant women in rural communities, do not get routine, reliable and affordable access to Hepatitis B testing facilities during pregnancy.\n\r\n3. “Thirdly (and finally), I respectfully urge you, Mr Speaker, to consider Ghana's grim situation, as highlighted here, and kindly refer this statement to a joint committee on Health, Finance and Social Welfare.\n\r\n“Their task should be to consider and recommend to this honourable House the most viable means by which the NHIS can bear the cost of testing, vaccination and treatment of Hepatitis B cases in the long term without crippling the already overburdened scheme. Their report will guide legal and policy response to the plague in a way that helps Ghana decisively defeat the virus.”\n\nRead the full statement made by Alexander Kwamena Afenyo-Markin on Tuesday, February 14, 2023, below:\n\n\n\nYou can also watch this episode of People & Places here:\n\n\n\r\nAE/SEA",
    "The Medical Superintendent at the Entrance University Hospital, Dr. Dzifa Demanya, has expressed worry over the failure of many Ghanaians to regularly check their health status.\n\r\nHe observed that most people hardly visit the hospital to check their health status, mostly because they do not want to spend money on their health when they are not sick.\n\r\nDr Dzifa Demanya gave the assertion at a free health screening organised by the Entrance University Hospital (EUH) in Accra on Tuesday, February 14,2023.\n\r\nOn Valentine’s Day, the Entrance University Hospital, in collaboration with the La Fé Eye Care Center in Accra, organised a free health screening for the public.\n\r\nThe move was part of the Entrance University Hospital’s corporate social responsibility.\n\r\nAt the event, a number of old men and women, children, persons with disabilities, and young adults were served with love.\n\r\nThe medical team checked weight, height, body mass index (BMI), sickling, hepatitis B, and others.\n\r\nFor those who tested their hepatitis B status and were negative, they were given the option of vaccination.\n\r\nPatrons also enjoyed free eye screening with subsidised glasses.\n\r\nAside from that, the scans were also discounted at 50 per cent for all those who went for that service.\n\r\nSpeaking with Atinka TV, Dr. Dzifa Demanya noticed that out of all the tests conducted, hypertension was prevalent.\r\nHe noticed that most people don’t work out and don’t eat right.\n\r\nAside from that, he said the economic struggle in the country has also contributed to the latter.\n\r\nMost of all, he said, people fail to visit the hospitals to check their health status, therefore, even when it was noticed at the free health screening that some had their blood pressure high, they could not be admitted because the people were not ready for that.\n\r\nMeanwhile, he urged the public to constantly visit the hospital to do regular checkups.\n\r\n“Do not wait until you hear about health screening before you take advantage of that, you can decide to do checkups quarterly so that if there is anything, you will know early,” he said.",
    "Some residents in the Ejisu Municipality have appealed to the Ghana Health Service (GHS) to consider banning the use of mobile phones by nurses during working hours. \n\r\nThis, according to them, will make the nurses pay much attention while on duty and also help save the lives of patients who need critical care and attention, especially during emergency situations.  \n\r\nThe residents made the appeal during the annual health performance review meeting organised by the Municipal directorate of the GHS at Ejisu. \n\r\nThey cited several instances of nurses on duty playing games on their phones while patients who needed critical attention were left unattended to.  \n\r\nThe attitude the residents claimed had led to the loss of many lives in the area and was preventing many people from accessing healthcare in government hospitals in the municipality. \n\r\nResponding to the accusations and the appeal by the residents, Mrs. Josephine Ahorsu, the Municipal Director of Health Services, condemned the behaviour of those nurses and said it was unethical for a nurse to use mobile phone while attending to a patient. \n\r\nShe assured the residents that the health directorate would work on their request to instill discipline among health workers in the area. \n\r\nMrs Ahorsu urged all health personnel in the municipality to take the accusations by the residents seriously and work as professionals, who understood the ethics of their work to regain the confidence of the people they served. \n\r\nThe purpose of the annual review meeting, she said, was to offer stakeholders the opportunity to evaluate the activities of health facilities and personnel in the municipality to help develop strategies to improve services to the public.",
    "Age. Growing older increases the risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and weakened or thickened heart muscle.\n\nSex. Men are generally at greater risk of heart disease. The risk for women increases after menopause.\n\n A family history of heart disease increases the risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age (before age 55 for a male relative, such as your brother or father, and 65 for a female relative, such as your mother or sister).\n\r\nSmoking. If you smoke, quit. Substances in tobacco smoke damage the arteries. Heart attacks are more common in smokers than in nonsmokers. If you need help quitting, talk to your healthcare provider about strategies that can help.\n\nUnhealthy diet. Diets high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol have been linked to heart disease.\n\nHigh blood pressure. Uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause the arteries to become hard and thick. These changes interrupt blood flow to the heart and body.\n\nHigh cholesterol. Having high cholesterol increases the risk of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis has been linked to heart attacks and strokes.\r\nDiabetes. Diabetes increases the risk of heart disease. Obesity and high blood pressure increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease.\n\nObesity. Excess weight typically worsens other heart disease risk factors.\n\nLack of exercise. Being inactive (sedentary lifestyle) is associated with many forms of heart disease and some of its risk factors, too.\n\nStress. Unrelieved stress may damage the arteries and worsen other risk factors for heart disease.\n\nPoor dental health. It's important to brush and floss your teeth and gums often. Also, get regular dental checkups. Unhealthy teeth and gums make it easier for germs to enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. This can cause endocarditis.\n\nPrevention\n\r\nThe same lifestyle changes used to manage heart disease may also help prevent it. Try these heart-healthy tips:\n\r\n• Don't smoke.\r\n• Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat.\r\n• Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week.\r\n• Maintain a healthy weight.\r\n• Reduce and manage stress.\r\n• Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.\r\n• Get good sleep. Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours daily.\n\n\r\nSource: mayoclinic",

    "A water consultant, Rev Dr Appiah Duah has stressed the need for government to intensify its efforts in arresting the alarming rate of pollution and contamination of our water bodies.\n\r\nThis is because hazardous chemicals like mercury, lead, arsenic, and cyanide used in the extraction of gold have resulted in the chemical pollution of soil and water bodies in mining areas.\n\r\nRev Dr Appiah Duah, who was speaking at the third commencement lecture at Somanya in the Yilo Krobo Municipality of the Eastern Region, pointed out that some of these chemicals have resulted in poisoning, organ impairment, and death in high concentrations, among others.\n\r\nSpeaking on the theme for the programme “Securing our Environment: Our Water, Our Future”, he mentioned that, even though there are 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030, Goal 6 of the SDG, which focuses on access to clean water and sanitation for all, ensures that all member countries of the UN prioritise accessibility to clean water and sanitation facilities for all citizens, as a fundamental human right is directly and indirectly linked to the achievement of several other SDG goals, such as poverty, hunger, and good health, among others.\n\r\nHence, he encouraged the regulatory agencies to perform their assigned roles and responsibilities, which will help completely eradicate illegal mining activities and take the necessary steps together with stakeholders to reclaim the degraded lands and restore the water bodies to perform their ecological functions.\n\r\nThe Deputy Minister for Education in charge of T-VET, Gifty Twum Ampofo noted that the environmental challenges facing the country require innovation and scientific solutions.\n\r\nThus, she stressed the importance of keeping young children in school for a long period, which will reduce the economic pressures that lure them into illegal activities.\n\r\nShe also encouraged parents and guardians to enroll their wards in STEM schools to help achieve the government’s vision of industrialising the economy.",
    "The condition of a 10-year-old girl [name withheld] who was born without genitals and resides at Kpong in the Lower Manya Krobo Municipality of the Eastern Region has left her family impoverished.\n\r\nMadam Rita Damegbo, the mother of the girl, who was emotional in narrating the ordeal under which they live with her daughter’s health issue, wants the general public to support them to undergo surgery to correct the anomaly.\n\r\nAccording to the 28-year-old mother who was speaking to Angel news reporter Jaman Dehyee Opambour, she gave birth to her beloved daughter some 10 years ago at the Akosombo Volta River Authority (VRA) Hospital through a Cesarean Section (SC).\n\r\nShe noted that following the CS delivery, she was comatose for three days after which she regained consciousness only to realise that her newborn baby possessed no anus or vagina.\n\r\n“So, I went to inform the nurses and immediately they gave us a letter of referral to Korle Bu Teaching Hospital for further treatment.\n\r\n“The doctors fast-forward conducted two separate surgeries on one side of her stomach and later created an artificial hole at her anus to enable her to respond to nature’s calls, but we spent a year at the hospital,” the mother of the 10-year-old girl recounted.\n\r\nHoping that the health situation of the minor would get better, it proved otherwise as Madam Damegbo indicated her daughter finds it difficult to respond to nature’s call. This, according to her, affects her stomach and makes her soil herself unknowingly.\n\r\nShe is thus using the medium to seek financial support from well-meaning Ghanaians, both at home and abroad, to find a lasting solution to the health problem, to enable her to enjoy life because the situation has forced her to sell all her belongings, rendering her helpless.\n\r\n“In fact with the buying of medicines and other activities I do for the health of my daughter I’m impoverished. I don’t know where to get any help. So please, people out there, help me to heal my daughter. I don’t want to lose her at this stage,” she told the journalist.\n\r\nOn her part, the grandmother of the girl child, who is currently taking care of her at their residence in South Senchi, a community in the Asuogyaman district of the Eastern Region, said they are without external help.\n\r\nAccording to Comfort Addo, she is left with no option but to use rags as a substitute for pampers in order to manage her granddaughter’s challenge since they are poor.\n\r\n“I use rag as pampers for her because as it stands now, I can’t afford pampers. Moreover, as I speak to you, I am also not that healthy,” the grandmother lamented.\n\r\nWhat is also troubling to the family, Madam Comfort Addo disclosed, is the conditions of the little girl which has made room for her peers to make a mockery of her during school hours, something she said dumps the soul of her granddaughter.\n\r\nThey are thus appealing to government, NGO, philanthropist among others to come to the rescue of their beloved daughter as she dreams of becoming a nurse in the near future.\n\nYou can also watch this episode of People & Places here:",
    "The Cape Coast Teaching Hospital (CCTH), in collaboration with the Himalayan Cataract Project (Cure blindness), a US-based foundation working to end blindness, has successfully performed free cataract surgeries on more than 1,250 people to save them from total blindness.  \n\r\nThe five-day health exercise is the largest single cataract intervention in Ghana.  \n\r\nThe surgical procedures were undertaken by nine ophthalmologists, including an American, who spent an average of eight minutes on each patient depending on the severity of their condition.  \n\r\nThe intervention, held every four months, is also used to train young doctors and nurses of the hospital to sharpen their skills to help end blindness.  \n\r\nDr Geoffery Tabin, Chairman and Co-Founder of the Project, said the goal of the exercise was to overcome “needless” blindness in the world.  \n\r\nHe indicated that at least, 80 per cent of the patients would have perfect vision right after the surgery but a few might not see perfectly due to other undetected eye conditions such as glaucoma.  \n\r\nHe explained that old age, poor nutrition, long exposure to smoke and direct sunlight were some major risk factors for cataract.  \n\r\nDr Tabin, who is also a Professor of Ophthalmology in Global Medicine, Stanford University, observed that blindness from treatable cataract was common in Ghana mainly due to the lack of adequate specialists.  \n\r\nHe said cataract was not normal in children but had become unfortunately common.  \n\r\nHowever, he noted, that there were only two specialists for children’s cataract in the whole country for which reason most children did not get care.  \n\r\nHe said even though the number and quality of doctors and specialists had improved over the past decade, there was the urgent need to train more of them to deal with the backlog of variety of eye conditions in the country.  \n\r\n“Ten years ago, when you had a retinal detachment, you had to go to America or India to have surgery, but now there are six retinal specialists in Ghana.  \n\r\n“Six retinal specialists for 30 million people is not enough. We need to have at least 50 retinal doctors,” Dr Tabin noted.  \n\r\nHe said the construction of an eye hospital at CCTH to be affiliated to the University of Cape Coast was on course and would train exceptional young doctors, nurses and assistants to create a sustaining programme.   \n\r\nDr Eric Kofi Ngedu, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the hospital, said cataract was among the top five eye conditions reported in the hospital over the years.  \n\r\nHe, therefore, labelled the collaboration with Cure Blindness as extremely critical and life-saving.  \n\r\nHe said the hospital since 2019, through the collaboration, had expanded and increased eye care service delivery in the Region. \n\r\nSo far, they had visited 1,050 communities and done 261 outreaches in which 54,142 patients were screened and 5,894 surgeries were successfully performed.  \n\r\nDr Ngedu further indicated that about six staff of the hospital had been trained as experts in quality eye care delivery.  \n\r\nHe expressed gratitude to Cure Blindness for the partnership and to government for granting waivers on the surgical tools and equipment for the exercise.",
    "Mr Anderson Obeng Amoako, the Disease Control Officer, Ada-East District, has called for enhanced education and sensitization to counter misconceptions and myths surrounding some diseases, which threaten healthcare delivery. \n\r\nHe noted that inadequate information was a major cause of the spread of diseases and urged stakeholders to intensify awareness to overcome these beliefs to improve healthcare. \n\r\nMr Amoako, in an interview with the Ghana News Agency, at Ada in the Greater Accra Region, said due to superstitions associated with some diseases,  family members of the sick preferred to visit shrines and churches for healing instead of seeking health care at the hospitals. \n\r\n“It is only when the sick person’s condition gets worse at these shrines and churches before the family rushes to the hospital when it is almost too late to save,” he noted. \n\r\nMost of these “superstitious” diseases could have easily been controlled at the initial stage, but often time was wasted at the prayer camp to no avail, he said. \n\r\n“When we delay by moving from one prayer camp to the other or from one traditional healer to the other, we only end up complicating the health condition of the sick person”. \n\r\nMr Amoako cited COVID-19 as an example, which some people associated with superstition, hence they refused to take the vaccines. \n\r\nHe added that Mpox was also being described as a form of superstitious or mystic sickness,  based on which people refused to take precautions. \n\r\nHe advised that health messages must be persuasive with a combination of various techniques to suit the specific needs of the people and encourage them to patronise health facilities for solutions to ailments.\n\nYou can also watch this edition of People & Places on GhanaWeb TV:",

Of course, not, to them, they were really excited and expectant.\n\r\nFast-forward to the ninth month and the day of delivery, this new couple boarded a car and travelled to the nearby hospital, full of hope and expectation.\n\r\nBut the unexpected happened! The worse episode began in the life of this nuclear family. Yes, this 28-year-old bride, who was also due to graduate from the university in few months' time, and the first daughter of her parents died together with her baby in the course of labour.\n\r\nYou can imagine the pain, misery and anguish that came on the groom and his family!\n\nAfrica, The Epicenter of Maternal Deaths\n\r\nUnfortunately, today, “maternal mortality is unacceptably high. About 295,00 women died during and following pregnancy and childbirth in 2017. The vast majority of these deaths (94%) in low-resource settings and most could have been prevented” (WHO, 2017).\n\r\nSurprisingly, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia accounted for approximately 86% (254,000) of the estimated global maternal deaths in 2017. And sub-Saharan Africa alone accounted for roughly two-thirds (195,000) of maternal deaths (WHO, 2017).\n\r\nThe NGO on A Mission to End Newborn & Maternal Mortality In Africa by 2063 Youth Rise International (YoRI), is a legally-registered and government-licensed grassroots non-profit organization in Ghana that fights the intersection of extreme poverty and neo-natal, infant and maternal mortality (NIMM) has spent the past 7 years ensuring that no mother or child dies before, during and after childbirth.\n\r\nIn 2018, Youth Rise International (YoRI) embarked on a series of deep individual, family, community and stakeholder engagement in the Western and Central Region of Ghana.\n\r\nWe were interested in discovering the root causes of NIMM in rural communities in Ghana. Also, we wanted to document the communities’ response to the practical solutions to NIMM or what every pregnant woman needs in order to prevent losing their life and/or that of their newborn during and after childbirth.\n\r\nInteresting discoveries were made and through those, Youth Rise International (YoRI) designed and rolled out the implementation of the ‘Zero Newborn and Maternal Mortality’ project in partnership with government hospitals, CHIPS Compounds and community stakeholders in 2019).\n\r\nIn this feature article, I have generously shared with you the 5 practical and grassroots-driven support every pregnant woman needs to avert newborn and maternal mortality before, during and after childbirth. To this end, every pregnant woman needs:\n\n1. Cash To Maintain Good Health\n\r\nThrough those participatory engagements, we discovered that the top root cause of NIMM was extreme poverty and economic hardship in families.\n\r\nThis dire situation was fuelled by climate change and its resulting impacts on the loss of family life as well as high unemployment rate.\n\r\nIt is common knowledge that pregnancy comes with a high level of routine expenses. Therefore, the family needs money to ensure that the pregnant woman eats well in order to achieve the right hemoglobin (HB) level as well as for the child to develop well.\n\r\nAlso, almost every month, the family needs cash to pay for scans, laboratory tests, injections, drugs and other bills during the Ante-natal clinic (ANC).\n\r\nMoreover, pre-and-post-delivery items such as baby clothing needed to warm the newborn within the first weeks of delivery are required. This is very critical because, if the baby is not well clothed, it can die of pneumonia.\n\r\nTherefore, they requested short-term cash support to address those inevitable costs over and above what they are able to pay from their meagre and unstable family income stream.\n\r\nSo, in the short-term, Youth Rise International (YoRI) pays directly to hospitals and health centers the cost involved in those critical expenses in addition to providing baby clothing and mother care materials for pregnant women and nursing mothers.\n\r\nThis has resulted in sharp reduction in neo-natal, infant and maternal mortality in our project communities in Ghana.\n\n2. Livelihood Support To Improve Family Income Sustainably\n\r\nClimate change and unemployment has really caused much damage to the livelihoods of families in rural areas in Ghana. Most of these families have lost their jobs or experienced crop failure due to unpredictable, unreliable and fluctuating rainfall patterns induced my climate change.\n\r\nAs a result, pregnant women are not able to eat well, provide decent accommodation and secure protection against malaria which is a key cause of maternal and neo-natal mortality in Ghana. To cushion family income and assist poor families to regain their economic dignity, Youth Rise International (YoRI), empowers families economically. Over the past years, they have equipped families with alternative livelihoods such as vocational/skills training and micro-venture development.\n\r\nAs a result, families are able to diversify their income sources as a coping mechanism from external and internal economic shocks. In the end, families are able to afford decent meal, accommodation and prevent against malaria and pay for drugs for pregnant women, newborns and nursing mothers thereby averting mortality.\n\n3. Ante-natal Clinic To Obviate Childbirth Complications\n\r\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) confirms that most neo-natal, infant and maternal mortality cases are preventable. The deep community and stakeholders’ engagement revealed that complications during childbirth is a leading cause of NIMM. Sadly, most of complications could have been avoided, if the pregnant woman has attended and followed the routine ANCs visits and reviews by midwives and medical doctors. How? When a pregnant woman attends ante-natal clinic (ANC), warning signs and potential complications are discovered early through scans and laboratory test.\n\r\nThen treatment can be initiated by midwives and medical doctors. However, sadly, the communities engaged indicated that most pregnant women do not attend ANCs.\n\r\nYouth Rise International’s (YoRI) team dived deeper to identify what accounts for the failure of pregnant women to attend ANC, though it’s critical to their lives and that of the fetus?\n\r\nTo our amazement, we identified issues such as ignorance (of the health implications of not attending the ANCs or patronizing the services of health facilities during pregnancy), access (difficulties in accessing ANC facility for families who lived in very remote and hard-to-reach rural communities in Ghana) and extreme poverty (their inability to pay for transportation every week/month and to cover expenses for scan, laboratory test, cost of drugs and other medical bills not covered by the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS).\n\r\nTo address this critical gap, Youth Rise International (YoRI) and its community partners such as Women In Distress Africa, Ghana Health Service and other faith-based organizations such as Elpis Chapel International have embarked on massive awareness-raising and sensitization campaigns.\n\r\nWhat is unique about their strategy is that they leverage on the socio-ecological model, health belief model and innovation diffusion theory to design and disseminate the campaign messages targeting behaviour and social change.\n\r\nThe evaluation of this campaign has revealed life-transforming outcomes and it’s more sustainable. To address the extreme poverty and economic factors, the solution and strategies proffered above under the cash and livelihood factors suffice.\n\n\n\r\nToday, majority of Ghana’s population live in the rural and remote areas. In those remote areas, culture, traditions and customs are really endemic and entrenched. Most of the indigenous people don’t accept the orthodox and modern medical care. They are used to resorting to herbs and medically unauthorized medication and health care.\n\r\nThis traditional system has heavily impacted the neo-natal, infant and maternal health space. For instance, from the deep community engagements, Youth Rise International (YoRI) discovered that in some of the communities, giving birth at a health facility was foreign. Rather, they encouraged pregnant women to give birth at home. Also, they don’t trust orthodox medicine.\n\r\nAs such, even when pregnant women receive drugs after attending ANC, they still have to use herbals and local concoctions which in most cases contradicts the impacts of orthodox medications.\n\r\nThe most worrying of all, is the practice of pregnant women giving birth at home or the house of a traditional birth attendants (TBAs).\n\r\nThese TBAs are untrained, unprofessional and used strange tools and devices which are not sterilized for labour.\n\r\nThey have contributed to high rate of neo-natal, infant and maternal mortality in rural Ghana especially because, in most cases, pregnant women are unduly delayed and complications heightens before referring them to a hospital or health center for proper medical care.\n\r\nTo lead behaviour and social change, Youth Rise International (YoRI) and its partners designed the Health Communication for Social Change Campaign.\n\r\nThrough this campaign, series of community awareness, sensitization and dialogue with custodians of culture and traditions and community leader to re-imagine culture and the health of the indigenes.\n\r\nThrough strong negotiations and dialogue, significant modifications and integration of modern ideas concerning the health and protection of women, children and men in rural communities have been achieved. \n\r\nThis has contributed to significant reduction of the rates of neo-natal, infant and maternal mortality in those communities.\n\n5. Quality Health Service Provision\n\r\nIt is undeniable fact that pregnant women and their families play a role in preventing neo-natal, infant and maternal mortality as well as the local community.\n\r\nHowever, the health system plays the most critical role. Through the deep and participatory community engagement, we discovered that some of the health workers were not helpful.\n\r\nMany pregnant women, indicated, they chose not to attend ANCs due to the poor attitudes and reception by health workers such as nurses and mid-wives.\n\r\nAccording to them, some health workers were rude towards them, caused unduly delays in the health service delivery and prioritized care and service to pregnant women from rich and wealthy families. Undeniably, this is unfair, unprofessional and discriminatory.\n\r\nTo address this issues, Youth Rise International (YoRI) and its partners such as Women In Distress Africa and Elpis Chapel International have embarked on dialogues with health workers and we are pushing for professional ethics and customer service training for all health workers especially those at the frontline with priorities given to nurses, midwives and pharmacist.\n\r\nWe are excited that such strategic approach has begun producing amazing results and contributing to the reduction in the rate of neo-natal, infant and maternal mortality in Ghana.\n\n2.

Through such a deep and participatory engagement, Youth Rise International (YoRI) discovered the root causes that drive such violations of human rights and the perpetuation of social injustice against pregnant women and their families.\n\r\nTo this end, to prevent such gross loss of lives, every pregnant woman and their family needs cash, livelihood, ante-natal care and mindsets and behaviour change.\n\r\nAlso, there is an urgent call to strengthen Ghana’s health system especially shaping the attitudes of health workers with a special focus on nurses, midwives and pharmacists who serve as the front-liners in hospitals, clinics and health centers.",

    "The Food and Drugs Authority (FDA) Ghana has adjudged the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital’s Pharmacy Department as the best compared to other health facilities in the country, after a review of its pharmacovigilance reports.\n\r\nThis achievement was made known in 2022 after a review of its 2021 reports by the FDA. This is contained in the LENS, the official mouthpiece of the FDA Ghana.\n\r\nPharmacovigilance, also known as drug safety, is the pharmaceutical science relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects associated with pharmaceutical products.\n\r\nThese spontaneous adverse reports on patients on treatment, are made by health workers (particularly doctors and pharmacists) and submitted to the FDA for causality assessment. \n\r\nThe Korle Bu Teaching Hospital has safety monitoring contact for pharmacists in all clinical departments. Their duty is to collaborate with other health workers to identify and report adverse effects involving drugs, contrast media, medical devices, blood and submit these to the FDA.\n\r\nThe Pharmacy Department reported over 120 adverse events in 2021. This placed them at the top of the chart and gained the Hospital more credibility.\n\r\nDue to this achievement, Pharmacist Stella Selassie Ahiate, a Senior Pharmacist and safety monitoring person at the Anti–Retroviral Therapy (ART) Adherence Counselling Unit, has been selected as the focal person for the Greater Accra Region.\n\r\nIn an interview, she noted that the recognition of performance from the FDA is a milestone that proves the positive impact pharmacists and other health workers make by monitoring the safety of drugs in the hospital.\n\r\nPharm Ahiate, who is also passionate about patient safety and the rational use of drugs (medicines), believes that the role of a pharmacist is to ensure that patients obtain the best therapeutic outcome from their treatment.",
    "The Government has been urged to prioritise the building of the economic resilience of communities and individuals as part of its peace-building activities. \n\r\nThis should be done through the provision of social amenities and opportunities to enhance citizens’ relevance and participation in society. \n\r\nThe recommendation was made on Tuesday during a dissemination workshop on findings from the Action Research on intergenerational, inter-religious peace-building in Northern Ghana, in Accra. \n\r\nThe research was carried out by the Catholic Relief Services (CRS) with support from the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) and the Centre for Conflict Transformation and Peace Studies (CECOTAPS). \n\r\nThe workshop had participants from Religious groups, Ministries, Departments and Development partners. \n\r\nPatrick Williams, Regional Programs Manager, CRS, in presenting the research findings, urged stakeholders to strengthen the capacity of youth and Muslim community leaders to engage directly with the youth to counter the malign influences of misinformation and violent extremists. \n\r\nHe said they should also actively identify and engage vulnerable people traditionally left out of the peace-building process. \n\r\nThe report suggested that peace builders scaled-up interreligious and intergenerational activities to build coalitions around common identities and objectives by engaging more fully with secular organisations such as vocational training programmes. \n\r\nThey were advised to foster cross-border cooperation and activities to better respond to the risks of extremism expansion. \n\r\nHe said Government could win over the trust of citizens by being present at the grassroots, listening to their concerns and addressing them. \n\r\n Williams said the US Government would foster deeper collaboration and support Ghana to incorporate the research findings into future policies. \n\r\n Daniel Mumuni, Country Representative, CRS Ghana, said the overarching goal of the research was to expand learning, improve practice, and document lessons in intergenerational and interreligious peacebuilding in Northern Ghana.  \n\r\nHe said the National Catholic Secretariat was currently leading the implementation of the second phase of the Sahel Peace Initiative, to restore community life and peace. \n\r\nThe initiative, he said, would focus on four core priorities: Dialogue and Mediation, Humanitarian Needs, Advocacy and Community Based Support. \n\r\nMr Mumuni said Ghana’s identity as a highly religious country with intergenerational differences, could contribute both negatively and positively to peace-building efforts. \n\r\n“It all depends on how we can effectively harness the potential and strengths of our peacebuilding efforts while improving upon the gaps or weaknesses,” he added. \n\r\nMadam Palwasha Kakar, Director of Religion and Inclusive Society, USIP, said peace and stability could not happen without the full participation of the youth in the country’s political, social, cultural and economic affairs. \n\r\nShe said the research was important to USIP because it focused on ways to break down barriers to youth participation in peacebuilding beyond working with the youth in silos and bringing them concretely into the dialogue process. \n\r\nMadam Kakar said the inclusion of women and youth was an intrinsic part of sustainable peace, adding that, the exclusion could increase fragility and contribute to violent conflict. \n\r\nShe noted that the youth were often the most vulnerable and affected by violent conflict globally, and yet, they were excluded from peacebuilding efforts. \n\r\nMadam Kakar said the engagement of religious actors, youth leaders, and religious youth in peace dialogues and joint activities would bridge community divides and foster sustainable peace. \n\r\nShe commended CRS for the research and said the USIP was interested in gaining a better understanding and learning the intergenerational module of dialogue from Ghana. \n\r\nSheikh Aremeyaw Shaibu, the spokesperson for the National Chief Imam, observed that most conflicts were influenced by economic factors and the inequitable distribution of resources within communities. \n\r\nHe said the notable feature of such conflict-prone areas were poverty, deprivation, marginalisation and idleness, which allowed terrorist groups to easily engage them to do their bidding. \n\r\nSheikh Shaibu said if people in such communities were “fruitfully engaged” and provided with social amenities and economic opportunities, they would not have the motivation to partake in violent acts. \n\r\nHe urged stakeholders to build partnerships around common challenges and collectively pursue solutions for them.",

    "Between December 2019 and January 12, 2020, a respiratory illness wreaking havoc among a cluster of people in Wuhan, China, was recorded and, by January 30, declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. \n\r\nThe death toll was unprecedented, only rivalled by the Black Death in the 1300s. Moreover, the pandemic took the most exacting toll on governments worldwide and revealed, rather glaringly, the state of unreadiness of governments in the face of such a global nightmare.\n\r\nHealth systems worldwide were tested more than ever, and resilience strings stretched thin. \n\r\nThe situation was even direr in this part of the world, considering the precarious position of most health systems on the continent of Africa.

The focus was boosting health sector accountability as well as vaccine equity distribution and battling hesitancy and misinformation.\n\r\nBudgIT Ghana unveiled two significant health sector reports and launched them in a Press Conference at the Alisa Hotel, Accra.\n\r\nOn January 31, 2023, civil society actors converged at the Fiesta Royale Hotel to discuss stakeholders' role in Boosting Health Sector Accountability and Battling Vaccine Misinformation in Ghana. \n\r\nIn participation were the Ghana Health Service, the Ministry of Health, the National COVID-19 Trust Fund, the Noguchi Memorial Institute, the Civil Society Platforms on Health and the Sustainable Development Goals, the Open Governance Partnership Secretariat, Revenue Mobilization Africa, the Swiss Chamber of Commerce, the International Human Rights Commission and a host of civil society organizations. \n\r\nIn a comment on Vaccine Accountability, Prof. Ben Adu Gyan of the Noguchi Memorial Institute highlighted the relevance of looking out for accountability in the distribution of vaccines and accountability in the efficacy of vaccines utilised in the fight against the virus. He outlined the role of institutions like the Noguchi Memorial Institute in the fight against Vaccine Misinformation. He said, \"Every day, we hear new theories and assertions about what these vaccines do. Therefore, we must consolidate the vaccine education effort.\"\n\r\nDr Michael Biney, from the Platform for Civil Society Organisations in Health and a member of Curious Minds Ghana, outlined the reality of administering and taking vaccines. \" The conspiracy theories are countless and increasing daily—stories of infertility, loss of sex drive, menstrual irregularities etc. The truth is vaccines are made for our good and not otherwise. Most reactions are from our bodies because of how it receives the vaccine. Reactions manifest differently, but they don't mean vaccines are out to make Africans sterile or barren.\"\n\r\nDr William Collins Asare of the COVID-19 National Trust Fund spoke on the need for such meetings to be stakeholder holistic and was impressed with the comprehensive stakeholder participation at the event. \" Most events like these, especially by think tanks and NGOs, do not bother to include institutions like the Ghana Health Service when the subject matter to be discussed is on health, which is quite ridiculous, so I am thrilled that they are here today with all of us.\" He went on to stress the need for Civil Society to be more unified and collaborated if ideals and objectives were to be met. \n\r\nThe team presented the project briefing and research findings on Phase II of the CTAP Project in a comprehensively detailed presentation at the meeting, which set the stage for the most engaging forum on the subject matter.\n\r\nMedia houses that covered the event were Multimedia Group Limited, GhanaWeb, Original TV and Radio, Pink FM, SikapaTimes, Accra FM, and Rainbow Radio.",

    "Breast Care International (BCI), a nonprofit organization in Ghana says the fight against preventable cancers should be tackled at the national level but not by an individual.\n\r\nIt says that can be done by the government imposing high taxes on alcoholic beverages, sugar-sweetening beverages, fast foods and cigarettes; which are among cancer risk factors.\n\r\nAccording to BCI, when preventable cancers like breast, cervical and prostate agents are either halted or restricted, it will limit people from buying and consuming them.\n\r\nThe President of Breast Care International (BCI), Dr. Mrs Beatrice Wiafe Addai, said this during the celebration of World Cancer Day (WCD) event on Saturday, February 4, 2023.\n\r\nIt was held at the premises of Peace and Love Hospital at Oduom in the Oforikrom municipal in the Ashanti region.\n\r\nThe theme for the event is the three-year-trot catch slogan “Close the Care Gap”\n\r\nWorld Cancer Day is an international day marked on 4 February annually to raise awareness of cancer and to encourage its prevention, detection, and treatment.\n\r\nWorld Cancer Day is led by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC), of which Breast Care International (BCI) is a member, to support the goals of the World Cancer Declaration, written in 2008.\n\r\n“Alcohol, sugar-sweetening beverages, fast foods and cigarettes consumptions are some of the things that bring people these cancers. The government can reduce the number of people exposed to these harmful agents by imposing high taxes on them,” she said.\n\r\n“The high prices on these harmful cancer agents will deter people from buying and consuming these products, especially to protect the children from falling prey and to help their future,” she added.\n\r\nDr. Mrs. Beatrice Wiafe Addai, who is also the CEO of Peace and Love Hospitals in Kumasi and Accra, Ghana, also observed that the continued spread of the disease around the world, particularly in poverty-endemic regions and communities, though cure was in short supply, remained an indictment on the conscience of all.\n\r\n“As a public health issue, cancers required the attention and commitment of all, pursuant to closing the gap,” she stated.\n\r\nOn breast cancer, Dr. Wiafe noted that though the BCI and PLHs since 2002 have on the forefront in creating awareness about the disease, a lot more needs to be done in Ghana, especially in the remote parts where the disease is rampant.\n\r\nOn a panel discussion during the event, she advocated for the re-training of health workers in these areas on breast cancer and other cancers for them also to spread education and awareness to avoid late-stage presentation of cases.\n\r\nA Consultant Gynecologist, Dr. Nii Oku Aryee, a panel member, expressed worry at the increased death rate of cervical cancer in Ghana.\n\r\nThe Medical Superintendent at the Mamponteng Government Hospital stated that 1,500 deaths are recorded in every 3,000 cervical cancer cases, a situation he attributed to a lack of education.\n\r\nHe, therefore, appealed to women to avail themselves of regular screening, testing and vaccination to avoid any unforeseeable consequences.",
    "With a protruding stomach and swollen feet, Yaa Adjeiwaa, sat on a bench in front of an uncompleted building, every morning, reminiscing her once vibrant life. She is forced to stay indoors and watch her life waste away.\n\r\n“I cry every night for death, I just want to die because this pain is unbearable” she cried.\n\r\nThe 40-year- mother of two is suffering from Hepatitis B. She says, her father died of the same disease two years ago.\n\r\n“Two years ago, my father was diagnosed of Hepatitis B and I was the one taking care of him, unfortunately we lost him early last year” she recounted.\n\r\nFew months after her father’s death, Yaa started having excruciating pains in her abdomen; she concluded it would be stomach upset possibly from indigestion. \n\r\n“I reported to the hospital and I was diagnosed of ulcer, I started ulcer treatment but the pain would not go” she said.\n\r\nJust before the 2022 Christmas holidays, Yaa Adjeiwaa’s condition worsened, she would often lose consciousness and stamina.\n\r\n“I visited the Amasaman Government Hospital and after further examination, I was diagnosed of Hepatitis B and it has not been easy” \n\r\nShe was later transferred to the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, for further scans and labs. The 40-year-old, single mother plied her trade at the Amasaman market where she sold cassava and plantain.\n\r\nShe is gradually lost her capital in fighting the disease.\n\r\n“I was told to do endoscopy which cost GHC1200 among other scans and labs but I could not afford it, I had used all my savings on medicines and scans. So, I came home waiting to die” she said sobbing. \n\r\nHepatitis B spreads when a person infected with the virus enters the body of someone who is not affected. The hepatitis B virus affects the liver.\n\r\n“I was told my liver had sores on it hence my protruding stomach and swollen feet” she added.\n\r\nExhausted all her funds, Yaa relied on friends and family for help but only one came through for her. \n\r\nShe lived with a friend at satellite, a suburb of Amasaman after she was ejected for defaulting her rent.\n\r\n“I appealed to all benevolent individuals to help me. I have two sons; the last one is in Senior High School and it’s been difficult to support them” she added.\n\r\nCrime Check Foundation under its Health Series through its donors gave Yaa Adjeiwaa money for her hospital to the tune of GHC3000. She was gradually recovering but according to doctors, the damage on the liver was grave.\n\r\nYaa Adjeiwaa gave up the ghost on January 24, 2023 at the Amasaman Government Hospital.",
    "A Psychology Lecturer at the University of Ghana, Dr. Ernest Dankwa, has urged the government to put in place adequate interventions to ensure the improvement of mental healthcare in the country.\n\r\nAccording to him, it is surprising that mental health issues are under discussed and under prioritised in national issues. He argued that mental disorder causes a heavy burden for society and therefore needs urgent attention. \n\r\nThe UG Don remarked in an interview with Radio Univers that the government's focus on nurses and doctors rather than mental health practitioners demonstrates the government's serious disregard for the country's mental health issues. He termed the situation as worrying.\n\r\n“It is unfortunate that our research is not prioritised in the country. \n\r\n\"When anything occurs in the nation, a psychologist can handle it… But we won't get the opportunity unless we first make an effort to participate as a group. The government always invests significantly in politics and neglects mental health issues. Whenever a medical doctor graduates from medical school, they are posted to hospitals to work. But every hospital requires a psychologist, which they don't post. \n\r\n“For instance, a preacher may have advised a woman not to undergo surgery or a cesarean section to allow herself to be cut by a knife. This person requires psychological help.\n\r\n“Because there’s fear in that person.  Then you post a doctor and leave a psychologist, which shows the lack of understanding of mental health issues by our leaders in this country,” he said. \n\r\nDr Ernest also appealed to the government to prioritise the health industry and provide funding to finance the mental healthcare needs of the country. \n\n\r\nAM/WA",
    "The Upper East Regional Director of the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA), Kasimu Abudulai, has bemoaned increasing reports of clients being asked to pay illegal charges when they visit healthcare facilities in the region.\n\r\nHe said some members of the public in the region, who are beneficiaries of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), complained of being charged to pay money for services covered by the Scheme.\n\r\nThe Regional Director noted that the authority was troubled by the reports and would address the issue to ensure that clients benefitted fully from it to improve access to healthcare services.\n\r\n“One issue we are going to pay particular attention to, in 2023, is the issue of illegal charges at the level of the facilities,” Abudulai told Ghana News Agency in an interview in Bolgatanga, adding, “they call it co-payment, it is not right.\n\r\n“It is getting rampant, it is happening in our region, unfortunately, we are one of the poorest regions in the country and unfortunately it is not even happening more at the lower levels like the CHPS compounds, it is rather happening more at the district hospitals and the regional hospital.\n\r\n“In Ghana, our NHIS is not a co-payment system, we finance everything that is covered by the Scheme because when we talk of co-payment, it is where it is officially agreed and signed that if you go to the hospital, you will pay a certain percentage of the bill for a service rendered to you while the Scheme covers the other percentage,” he added.\n\r\nHe furthered that in other countries where a co-payment system was practised, the higher level one attained the higher percentage one was likely to pay which system, was not allowed in Ghana.\n\r\nAs part of efforts to tame the phenomenon, Co-payment Committees have been established at all levels, including the national, regional and district with guidelines to help reduce or eliminate the challenge.\n\r\nHe said the committees would help identify facilities involved in illegal charges and will engage them to address the issue to relieve vulnerable people of unnecessary burden, he added.\n\r\nThe Regional Director noted that the committee had already engaged the management of Zebilla Hospital who were charging a sanitation levy of GH₵5.00 on clients who visited the facility including NHIS clients which they promised to stop.\n\r\n“We have some issues with the Bolgatanga regional hospital, which is yet to be resolved because they are doing some top-ups on NHIS clients and they are giving the Authority reasons why they were doing so but the matter is being handled by the national committee for a solution,” he said.",
    "A total of 854,206 persons in the Central Region have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 since it was rolled out in 2021. \n\r\nThe figure represents 50 per cent coverage of the total target of 1,693,530 eligible individuals, 15 years and above, expected to take the vaccine. \n\r\nBenjamin Adjei, the Regional Coordinator of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), Ghana Health Service, disclosed this at a stakeholder's engagement on the total outcome since the fifth roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccination exercise in the region. \n\r\nThe stakeholders include the Ghana Red Cross Society, Ghana Education Service, Information Service Department, and the media. \n\r\nThe round five roll-outs, which began last year, saw the Ghana Health Service training, assessing and supervising the districts to ensure effective and smooth implementation of the vaccination. \n\r\nThe region received 2,428,912 vaccines with  2, 382,740 shared and 2,022,418 administered across all the metropolitan, municipal and district assemblies. \n\r\nA total of 1,120,368 of the population have received their first dose, 558,156 with two doses,  and 343,894 taking the booster. \n\r\nThe region, Adjei said, was making headway in the prevention and protection of the citizenry from contracting the novel virus but admitted there were challenges. \n\r\nThe challenges include a low level of awareness within some districts and a high level of vaccine hesitancy among the citizenry. \n\r\nAgain, verbal assault on the health workers, who also educate the people on the importance of taking the vaccination, was rife. \n\r\nThe stakeholders advised the Service to conduct a survey to monitor and track the pattern of vaccinations to have a true picture of the exercise. \n\r\nThey said communication mechanisms must be strengthened and implemented throughout the Region and build the capacity of staff on Interpersonal Communication Skills to help deal with vaccine hesitancy. \n\r\nDr Godfred Kwabena Sarpong, Deputy Director in charge of Public Health, pledged the Service’s commitment to ensuring all persons were safe and vaccinated against COVID-19. \n\r\nHe called on the public to accept the vaccine to protect themselves, their families and loved ones from the disease.",

We are unable to purchase test kits and reagents for the testing of people. Due to a lack of adequate funding, pregnant women and their children have also been impacted.

    "Wacam, a community based human rights and environmental mining advocacy non-governmental organisation (NGO), has stated that it has never shied away from supporting farmers in mining communities in the Tano North Municipality of the Ahafo Region and others, from defending their rights and properties.\n\r\nThe Associate Executive Director of Wacam, Mrs Hannah Owusu-Koranteng, who made the statement, was reacting to a news item by Accra-based Peace FM on Wednesday, February 1, 2023, which pointed the finger of blame on the organisation.\n\r\nThe said news item said some chiefs in the operational areas of Newmont Ahafo Mine (including communities such as Yamfo, Afrisipa, Susanaso, Techire and Adrobaa) led by the chief of Yamfo, visited the Deputy Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, Hon Mireku Duker, and blamed Wacam for helping farmers in these areas to protect their properties from the mining company.\n\r\nThe Peace FM story continued that the chiefs chided Wacam for assisting the vulnerable farmers in the above areas for engaging Wacam to use legitimate means to protect their properties.\n\r\nAccording to Mrs Owusu-Koranteng, it is pathetic for the chiefs to blame Wacam in its advocacy work, and more especially, when the farmers had engaged the NGO to help them protect their rights and properties from the “devastating operations of Newmont.”\n\r\nShe said Regulation 2 of the Compensation and Resettlement Principles, LI 2175 (2012) states that a person whose interest in land is affected by the granting of mineral right may engage the services of qualified persons to protect his/her interests .\n\r\nTherefore, the farmers are acting within the remit of the law by engaging Wacam to support them in the protection of their properties, the Associate Executive Director of Wacam explained.\n\r\n“Is the Yamfo Chief and the other chiefs in the Tano North Municipality now the mouthpiece of Newmont?, she quizzed.\n\r\nShe emphasised that inasmuch as Newmont has the right to use its allies including chiefs, lawyers, security personnel among others to protect its interest, the ‘vulnerable farmers’ in the Tano North municipality equally have same right to seek support from advocacy organisations such as Wacam, a human rights, environmental and mining advocacy NGO, that has been operating in about 180 communities in 7 regions of Ghana.\n\r\n“Wacam’s mining advocacy which spans over the twenty-three (23) years has empowered communities affected by mining operations to protect their rights against corporate power. As a knowledge organisation, Wacam’s vast and rich knowledge on mining and environment has benefited government, researchers, students among others. Wacam’s advocacy has helped the country and regulators in holding mining companies accountable to pay compensation in situations of cyanide spillages,” she indicated.\n\r\nMrs. Owusu-Koranteng averred that examples abound of how Wacam, through its activities, has exposed attempts by mining companies to cover up cyanide spillages and corporate cruelties against poor people living in areas of mining operations by big mining companies like Newmont.\n\r\n“Wacam was very instrumental in exposing the cyanide spillage of Newmont Ahafo Mine which compelled the company to pay a fine of $5 million US dollars imposed on them for spilling cyanide into community rivers and attempting to cover up.\n\r\n“…Wacam is proud that its vigilance helped to expose the Newmont Ahafo cyanide spillage resulting in a fine against Newmont which had been used for the development of community projects including a clinic,” she said.\n\r\nTo this end, Mrs Owusu-Koranteng reiterated that Wacam is committed to use legal and rights advocacy to continue the support to the vulnerable people affected by the operations of multinational companies, stressing that “Wacam is very proud of this noble objective.”",
    "Ghana continues to record a high number of related breast cancer deaths.\n\r\nNecessary steps to help stem the deaths are lacking and government appears helpless if not unperturbed.\n\r\nAbout ninety percent of patients, according to experts require Radiotherapy treatment but unfortunately, the country has only two public Radiation centres.\n\r\nRecords show that five Ghanaian women die daily of breast cancer, and advocates like the Executive Director of Meena Breast Cancer Foundation (MBCF), Ibrahim Oppong Kwarteng believe it should be declared a pandemic to save humanity.\n\r\n“The rate at which women are losing their lives, we must declare it a pandemic,” said Mr Kwarteng.\n\r\nMr Kwarteng who additionally heads Crime Check Foundation lost his wife, Amina Oppong Kwarteng after a fierce battle with breast cancer in 2022.\n\r\nAccording to a GLOBOCAN 2020 report, Ghana is estimated to record 4,645 new breast cancer cases. This is more than double the estimated 2,062 new cases in 2012 with nearly 50% dying.\n\r\nThe high mortality rate is said to be mainly attributed to late-stage presentation, and more worrying, most women affected with the disease are below 50 in Ghana.\n\r\nThis according to Ibrahim Oppong Kwarteng is due to the low sensitization of the disease and trivializing its devastations.\n\r\n“The one-month sensitization dedicated to breast cancer is a joke if we really want to win the fight against the canker. We at MBCF want to fight breast cancer every day not only in October.\n\r\n“Unlike HIV/AIDS, we have underestimated breast cancer but its devastation is huge. Why can’t we pay attention to the disease to reduce its effect like that of AIDS? That is what we want to do at MBCF,” he said.\n\r\nAside from sensitization and education on the disease, the most important action to saving lives is treatment, and ‘Radiotherapy’ plays a core role in the process using a machine called Linear Accelerator or LNAC.\n\r\nExplaining the role of radiotherapy, the head of the Oncology Unit at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Eric Brobbey, said it is administered to kill the cancer cells or minimize their growth.\n\r\nHe says the treatment does not have any alternative and cannot be left out of the three basic treatments for breast cancer; surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\n\r\n“Patients are made to undergo the method on a number of working days depending on so many factors like the stage, and how advanced the disease has got to determine the number of days to be on the machine. You can undergo the treatment like three or even five weeks,” he clarified.\n\r\n“About ninety percent of patients need radiation. After the surgery or the chemotherapy, you need radiation. Whether total mastectomy or conservative surgery,” he indicated.\n\r\nSadly, Ghana has only two public Radiation centres; each at the Korle-Bu and Komfo Anokye Teaching hospitals.\n\r\nThis according to Mr Brobbey has made the cost of undergoing the treatment set high as a result of a regular breakdown of the machines from the pressure of serving an overwhelming number of patients.\n\r\n“At Korle-Bu, the price for radiation ranges between Five Thousand Ghana cedis (GHC 5,000) to Twelve Thousand Ghana cedis (GHC 12,000). How many patients can afford this? They would choose to go home and die,” he fumed.\n\r\n“The centre at Komfo Anokye serves those in the Northern part of the country and Korle-Bu serves those in the South so you can imagine the pressure. I do not know why government cannot provide the machines at least at every regional hospital to ease the pressure and reduce the cost because National Health Insurance does not cover radiotherapy,” he added.\n\r\nThere is a third Radiation Centre but it is privately owned by the Ghana Sweden Medical Centre, which according to Mr Brobbey ranges in cost from Twenty-Four Thousand Ghana cedis and above per treatment.\n\r\nThe Nurse, who is also a Board Member of Meena Breast Cancer Foundation (MBCF), further stated that there was no alternative to the treatment and omitting it means surviving the canker is slim.\n\r\nHe urged breast cancer patients to undergo all recommended treatments to save their lives.\n\r\n“When you are recommended to go through the treatments that are surgery, chemotherapy and radiation and you leave one out, the disease is likely to reemerge,” he cautioned.\n\nEstablishment of Specialized Breast Cancer Hospitals\n\r\nMBCF called for the establishment of specialized breast cancer hospitals to focus on cure for the disease with experts conducting advanced research and providing necessary equipment to fight the disease.\n\r\n“If it is possible, government should establish a specialized breast cancer hospital to make access to treatment very easy. This way, I am certain that the mortality rate associated with the disease will be reduced drastically,” Mr Kwarteng made a strong appeal to government and stakeholders.\n\nMeena Breast Cancer Clinics\n\r\nThe Foundation has however taken the lead in its own effort to construct Clinics in some selected Senior High Schools after two students of Potsin T.I Ahmadiyya Senior High School were detected to have lumps in their breasts.\n\r\nThe clinic would have a mini-theatre among other facilities to allow for minor breast cancer treatment like biopsy.\n\r\nThe first of such facility is under construction at Potsin T.I AMASS to serve the school and the Potsin community for general illnesses as well. \n\r\nThe project is in honour of the late Amina Oppong Kwarteng.\n\r\nShe pledged to wage a relentless war against the disease while in her sick bed but she, unfortunately, did not survive.\n\r\nIt is based on her vision Meena Breast Cancer Foundation has been established.",
    'CANCER! As scary as the word sounds, means a lot of different things.\n\r\nHowever, the most common among all these is the disease. This is caused by an uncontrolled division of abnormal cells in a part of the body. There are many types of cancers that attack the human body and almost all of them are fatal.\n\r\nSome take time to take adverse effects while others are just not time friendly.\n\r\nThe GLOBOCAN estimates that 16,600 cases of cancer occur annually in Ghana, yielding an age-standardized rate of 109.5 cases per 100,000 persons. Each year, the world celebrates "World Cancer Day" in the month of February to create awareness about the various types, symptoms, and prevention of cancer.\n\r\nOften, cancer patients need extra care and attention to help them go through relatively tough periods of rehabilitation and recovery. This year, World Cancer Day is slated for Saturday, 4th February 2023 under the theme: "Close the care gap".\n\r\nJumia, Africa’s leading e-commerce company discusses the importance of cancer awareness by highlighting the most common cancers in Ghana as well as their causes and possible ways of prevention below:\n\nBreast Cancer - Maybe the most talked about or most popular cancer worldwide. According to the 2020 GLOBOCAN report, Ghana is estimated to record 4,645 (20.4%) new breast cancer cases which are more than double the estimated 2,062 new cases in 2012, with close to 50% of them dying;\n\r\nthe high mortality rate is mainly due to late-stage presentation. Most of the women affected with breast cancer are below the age of 50 in Ghana (58.2%). Breast cancer happens when cells in your breast grow and divide in an uncontrolled way, creating a mass of tissue called a tumor.\n\r\nSigns of breast cancer can include feeling a lump in your breast, experiencing a change in the size of your breast, and seeing changes to the skin on your breasts. Mammograms, self-checks, and regular checks by health professionals can help with early detection. Early detection helps breast cancer patients to live long fulfilling lives while late-stage detection can be fatal.\n\nLung Cancer - According to the WHO data published in 2020 Lung Cancers Deaths in Ghana reached 237 or 0.14% of total deaths. This is alarming considering the major cause of lung cancer is smoking of cigarettes.\n\r\nLung cancer also can be caused by using other types of tobacco (such as pipes or cigars), breathing secondhand smoke, being exposed to substances such as asbestos or radon at home or work, and having a family history of lung cancer.\n\r\nThe best way to prevent lung cancer is to avoid smoking of any form whether primary or secondary. Lung cancer is treated in several ways, depending on the type of lung cancer and how far it has spread.\n\r\nPeople with non-small cell lung cancer can be treated with surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, or a combination of these treatments. People with small cell lung cancer are usually treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\n\nProstate Cancer - Prostate cancer is cancer that occurs in the prostate. The prostate is a small walnut-shaped gland in males that produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm. Prostate cancer affects about 60% of black men. The Ghana Cancer Control Strategy plan document revealed that 200 out of every 100,000 men in Ghana are suffering from this cancer.\n\r\nWhile some types of prostate cancer grow slowly and may need minimal or even no treatment, other types are aggressive and can spread quickly. Prostate cancer that\'s detected early, when it\'s still confined to the prostate gland has the best chance for successful treatment.\n\r\nUsually, there are no signs or symptoms in its early stages. However, more advanced cases can cause signs and symptoms such as trouble urinating, decreased force in the stream of urine, blood in the urine, blood in the semen, bone pain, losing weight without trying, and erectile dysfunction.\n\r\nMany health professionals advise men to reduce their risks of prostate cancer by choosing a healthy diet full of fruits and vegetables, regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and frequent medical checks to know their status.\n\r\nCervical Cancer - Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that occurs in the cells of the cervix; the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. Various strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually transmitted infection, play a role in causing most cervical cancer.\n\r\nCurrent estimates from the ecancer organization indicate that every year 2,797 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 1,699 die from the disease in Ghana\n\r\nThis is quite alarming and should be given extra attention. Early-stage cervical cancer generally produces no signs or symptoms. However, signs and symptoms of more-advanced cervical cancer include, vaginal bleeding after intercourse, between periods or after menopause, watery, bloody vaginal discharge that may be heavy and have a foul odor, and pelvic pain or pain during intercourse. There are many risk factors that we should take into account.\n\r\nThese include Risk factors for cervical cancer include having many sexual partners, Early sexual activity, having sex at an early age, having other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), a weakened immune system, smoking, and exposure to miscarriage prevention drugs. To help prevent or reduce these risks, women are advised to get the HPV vaccine and have routine Pap tests, practice safe sex and avoid smoking. \n\nColon/rectum Cancer - Maybe the least prevalent of the cancers mentioned so far. In Ghana, the incidence of colon cancer remains low at 3.9 cases per 100,000. However, it is a serious issue and shouldn’t be taken lightly.\n\r\nCommon causes of colorectal cancer are lack of regular physical activity, having diets low in fruit and vegetables, a low-fiber and high-fat diet, or a diet high in processed meats, being overweight, and obesity alcohol consumption and tobacco use.\n\r\nMany doctors and health professionals suggest that people may reduce their risk of developing colorectal cancer by increasing physical activity, keeping a healthy weight, limiting alcohol consumption, and avoiding tobacco.\n\r\nAs the world observes World Cancer Day on 4th February 2023, it is imperative that education about all cancers become widespread in rural and urban areas. Parents and guardians should teach their wards, health professionals should always advise and educate patients about the risk factors and preventive measures.\n\r\nAbove all things, patients living with cancer or undergoing treatments deserve all the care and attention they can get. Stigmatization of cancer patients should be completely avoided while cancer survivors should be encouraged to share their stories in order to motivate others going through similar challenges.',
    'The Ghana Fisheries Recovery Activity (GFRA) has launched the Safe Fish Certification and Licensing Scheme (SFCLS) to regulate the fish processing sector through the accreditation and licensing of fish processors.\n\r\nThe programme was launched in collaboration with the Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development (MoFAD), the Fisheries Commission, the Ghana Standards Authority (GSA) and the Food and Drugs Authority (FDA)\n\r\nThe Deputy Minister for Fisheries and Aquaculture Development, Mr Moses Anim, who spoke at the launch on Tuesday in Accra, said the Certification and Licensing scheme, which was developed from the 2019 pilot of the "Class one" recognition scheme, would ensure the production of safe fish and healthy seafood.\n\r\n"The government has prioritized the National Fish Processors and Traders Association (NAFPTA) to change the fortunes of women in the fisheries value chain, thus the Ministry supports the implementation of this scheme as a key intervention to address food safety issues in our small-scale fish processing sector," he added\n\r\nHe disclosed that under the scheme, fish processors would follow a code of conduct to meet health and hygiene standards to reduce contaminants.\n\r\nMr Paul Bannerman, Deputy Executive Director of the Fisheries Commission (FC), explained that the FC, in collaboration with GFRA, would strengthen the capacity of fish processors by providing training on hygienic fish handling and good processing practices before facility auditing to ensure processors qualify for certification.\n\r\nHe reaffirmed the Commission\'s plans to establish internal frameworks for facility audits and certification applications.\n\r\nThe launch featured cooking demonstrations showcasing certified fish that had been processed as well as an exhibition of fish products that could be purchased in both domestic and foreign markets.',
    "The deputy Information Minister, Fatimatu Abubakari, has stated that one of the biggest challenges confronting Agenda 111 is the acquisition of land to build the state-of-the-art hospitals.\n\r\nPresident Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo launched the Agenda 111 project on Tuesday, August 17, 2021, pledging to build 111 hospitals across the country.\n\r\nDuring the commissioning of the project in Trede, in the Ashanti Region, the president said, among other things, that the project would provide 20,000 jobs for health professionals when completed.\n\r\nSpeaking about this on Atinka FM‘s morning show, AM Drive with Kaakyire Ofori Ayim, Fatimatu Abubakar said, “With Agenda 111, the government envisaged that once it began, it would be completed within 18 months.” Let me give you examples of why some of the projects have stalled, although 87 of them are at various stages of completion or have already started. “The Eastern Regional Hospital is far ahead; that at Asuogyaman is almost complete; go to Kpone Katamanso and see; that in my village is under construction; “Trede in the Ashanti Region, and Nantong is under construction; but there are some zones that have peculiar problems and require redesign.”\n\r\nShe continued that, “Look at a place like the Greater Accra Region, look at Ayawaso North, which is Mamobi, Ayawaso East, which is Nima; and Ayawaso Central, which is Alajo, all they have between Nima and Mamobi is the Mamobi Polyclinic, not a district hospital, the design of Agenda 111 is that we need 15 acres of land to do a state-of-the-art district hospital that meets international standards, where are you going to get 15 acres of land at Nima? Mamobi or Alajo?”\n\r\nFatimatu Abubakar again said, “That also means that the government has to realize that some of the districts, even though they need these district hospitals, have a peculiar problem with land, so you have to re-design the hospital from the original architectural design given to the contractors across the country who are doing the same thing, which is more of a horizontal ground development for us to now look at a vertical development so that instead of 15 acres, even when you get two acres, you can change the design to fit the peculiar structure of that place, and it will affect costing and it will affect designing.\n\r\nMeanwhile, Fatimatu Abubakar admitted that the cost of the Agenda 111 project might change due to the redesign of some of the projects.",

    'George Opoku Amponsah, a Social Interest Advocate, Politician and farmer has appealed to the President of the Republic to rather than anything address the nation on the 6th of March instead of the usual commemorative activities that are done across Metropolitan Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs), regional as well as national levels.\n\r\nIn a petition signed on the last day of January 2023 and delivered to the Presidency with copies to the Speaker of Parliament, Council State Chairman, the Interior minister and Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei-Tutu II, Mr. Amponsah stated that the current economic conditions in the country make it untenable to use state funds for an exercise that could be replaced with one state broadcast from the Presidency.\n\r\nHe noted that the ongoing Domestic Debt Exchange(DDE) programme as well as the challenges with payment of former NABCo trainees as well at the challenges in paying personnel at the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP) give meaning to government to rather use savings from the upcoming state activity to cushion itself or service debts owed government employees.\n\r\nThe petitioner argues with a hypothesis that if the 216 MMDAs across the country were each using 10, 000 cedis to carry out the upcoming 6th march celebration, a cessation of same would save the country a whopping GHC 2,160,000.00.\n\nARGUMENTS:\n\r\nThe Social Interest Advocate further argues that a halt of the celebrations at the 16 regional capitals if they were to use GHC 20, 000 can now save the nation a staggering GHC 320  000.00.\n\r\nSimilarly, Mr Opoku Amponsah said the national celebration intended to be held at the Volta region if they were to use at least GHC 500, 000. 00 could now be saved with a halt to same.\n\r\nIn total, the best youth farmer at Juaben in his petition posited that the Presidency by consideration of his appeal would be saving the country an astronomical amount of GHC 2, 980 000.00 when it decides to halt the independence day celebrations.\n\nAPPEAL:\n\r\nSpeaking to this reporter, the petitioner said it was important that government showed concern about the worsening economic conditions in the country by acting considerately and appropriately. \n\r\nHe noted that no one spends recklessly when that person realises that what they have cannot sustain them in life.\n\r\nMr Opoku Amponsah, therefore, called on the President to make use of what has become famously called "the fellow Ghanaian series" to address the nation on the 6th of March as the nation prepares for the 66th edition than the use of state funds for same across the country.\n\r\n"I am confident that the Presidency would see reason in my petition and consider same so that we can utilise our state resources prudently since what we are seeing now is a semblance of an economic crisis which does not warrant profligate spending on just a 2-hour march," Mr. Opoku Amponsah stated.',
    "All persons and entities found culpable in the COVID-19 Audit Report released by the Auditor General should be prosecuted - that is the call of the Deputy Country Director of SEND GHANA, Dr. Emmanuel Ayifah. \n\r\nContained in a statement issued by the institution, Dr. Ayifah expressed disappointment in the fact that so much money was misappropriated from the funds that were set aside for the pandemic. \n\r\n“Multiple reports suggest that a substantial part of the COVID-19 funds have been grossly misapplied and channelled to fund other government interventions and flagship programs. It is sad to note that out of nearly GH¢22 billion that was raised to fight the COVID-19 pandemic between March 2020 to June 2022, just a little over half (GH¢12 billion) was used to fight the pandemic and its related impact,” he said in the release. \n\r\nThe statement also commended the Auditor General for heading to SEND GHANA’s earlier call on the state and parliament to ensure that it ensures there is value for money in terms of the disbursement of COVID-19 funds. \n\r\n“In April 2022, SEND GHANA called on the Supreme Audit Institutions, the Auditor General Department and the Parliament of Ghana to, as part of their oversight role, conduct special audit into COVID-19 related expenditures to ensure value for money,” it added. \n\r\nThe SEND GHANA boss also stated that it is his hope that the release of this audit report would not only become another one of such cases where no action is taken on the outcomes of such investigations. \n\r\nDr. Emmanuel Ayifah has therefore called for heads to roll. \n\nRead the full statement below:\n\n\n\r\nAE/WA",

    "Ghana recorded four deaths and 116 confirmed cases of the Monkeypox disease in 2022, in 14 out of the 16 regions.\n\r\n Two deaths were recorded in Upper East and one each in the Greater Accra and Central regions.\n\r\n The Savannah and Ahafo regions did not record any cases, Dr Farida Abdulai, the Deputy Director, Ghana Health Service (GHS), disclosed during a community stakeholder engagement at Ningo-Prampram in the Greater Accra Region.\n\r\n It was organised by the GHS, in collaboration with the USAID Breakthrough Action-Ghana programme, to educate the public on measures to overcome the disease.\n\r\n Dr Abdulai said Monkeypox could affect anyone despite the age, disclosing that a 13-day old baby got infected and died.\n\r\n However, more than half of the confirmed cases were aged between 16 and 39 years.\n\r\n In August, 2022, Monkeypox was renamed ‘Mpox’ to stem stigmatisation, she said, and that the virus spread through respiratory droplets and close contact with the rashes of an infected person.\n\r\n Dr Abdulai mentioned the symptoms to include acute fever with a body temperature of more than 38 degrees Celsius, coughing, cold, backache, sore throat, weakness, and rashes.\n\r\n “Therefore, seek immediate medical attention anytime you experience these symptoms,” she said, and that a free lab test would be run to determine whether one had the infection or not.\n\r\n The result is then taken to the National Public Health Reference Lab for confirmation.\n\r\n Dr Abdulai advised against the intake of alcohol or bathing in the sea as treatment of the disease as those were mere myths.\n\r\n “Those are not the remedy for the sickness, rather seek proper health care services,” she stated.",
    "A Hohoe Magistrate Court has ordered Francis Ahiaho and Samuel Tenkpor, both household heads to construct a toilet before February 27, 2023.  \n\r\nThey were brought before the Court for refusal to construct household latrine and depositing of faeces in polythene bags behind their living room and bathhouse.  \n\r\nAhiaho pleaded guilty while Tenkpor pleaded guilty with explanation but could not be exonerated of the charge.  \n\r\nThe Court granted them a bail of GH¢1,000 with two sureties each and they will re-appear in Court on February 27 for sentencing. \n\r\nProsecuting, Mr Frank Azila-Gbettor told the Court presided over by Madam Edith Lucy Dzormeku that the accused people were household heads who inherited the house from their late father.  \n\r\nHe said on February 2, last year, a team of Environmental Health Officers in charge of the area during their routine premises inspection, detected that occupant of the two accused people’s premises wrapped faeces in black polythene bags and deposited in the house especially at the back of their living rooms and the bathhouse. \n\r\nMr Azila-Gbettor said the officers drew the attention of first accused person’s wife concerning the nuisances found in their premises in the presence of one other woman also stayed in the same house. \n\r\nHe said the two accused people were invited to the office on February 4 and they pleaded for a month extension to enable them construct latrines for their households. \n\r\nMr Azila-Gbettor said an agreement was reached between the two and the officer in-charge which was fully documented and signed by the first accused person. \n\r\nHe said on May 24, which was after three months, the officers made a follow up visit to the house and to their surprise, the practice of defaecating in polythene bags and depositing some in the premises continued and no latrine was also built. \n\r\nMr Azila-Gbettor said subsequent visits made on July 1, September 13, November 7 and December 21 revealed that the phenomenon persisted, and the latrine was still not built. \n\r\nHe said the occupants still practiced open defecation and hoarding human excreta in the house. \n\r\nMr Azila-Gbettor noted that on January 11 this year at about 0830 hours when the summons was served on the accused people, there was evidence of open defecation as usual.  \n\r\nHe noted the absence of household latrines in houses, forced household members to practice open defecation either directly defecating on the bare ground or wrapping human faeces in polythene bags and depositing them at unauthorized places in communities.  \n\r\nMr Azila-Gbettor said the act possibly generated bad odour, breeding of houseflies and resulted in outbreak of diseases including cholera and typhoid fever.",
    'The closure of a public toilet that had helped to mitigate open defecation at Adjei Kojo in the Tema West Municipality, Greater Accra Region, has resulted in anxiety among residents, most of them unhappy. \n\r\nA visit by the Ghana News Agency to the facility, situated a few meters from the Adjei Kojo Lorry Station, revealed that it had been closed for about six years now. \n\r\nThis has left community members questioning, with anger, why the facility has been left unattended for years, with the people having no option but to walk for quite a distance to access private toilet facilities. \n\r\nThey have, therefore, called on the authorities to relook at the public toilet, correct the defects preventing its functioning, and ensure it was reopened without delay. \n\r\nM Joseph Anloadey, a resident, admitted that the facility used to operate from time to time until it was reconstructed into an ultramodern one, but was closed down after about a month due to poor construction works and leakages.\n\r\n"There were occasional leakages from the facility during the period it was operating. We reported the issue to the authorities because the manhole was getting filled with water," he said.\n\r\nMr. Anloadey said the situation forced some residents to walk for a distance to access private toilet facilities with higher fees.\n\r\n“Those who could not afford that find other ways to attend to nature\'s call. And your guess is as good as mine,” he told the GNA. \n\r\nMr. Oliver Addison, another resident, said the reasons for the closure may be due to political inexpediency, where one administration constructs a facility and the other refused to continue with or manage the project. \n\r\nHe admitted that the facility was beneficial as it was closer to residents, centered at a vantage point, and convenient.\n\r\nMr. Bright Gameli, who operates a shop around the facility, recounted how it was established to solve a dire need of residents in the community. \r\nHe appealed to the Tema West Municipal Assembly to ensure the facility was reconstructed and managed properly to enhance usage and environmental cleanliness.',
    "A total of 221 new cases of lepro\xadsy were recorded across the country by end of September last year, of which seven, were children.\n\r\nAccording to the Ghana Health Service (GHS), in the last five years, the country has detected at least 200 new cases of leprosy annually, indicating an ongoing transmission of the causative agent of the disease among the population.\n\r\n“We get new cases, we treat and then the following year, we get new ones, we treat and the cycle continues which tells you that the bacteria is in circulation and everyone is at risk.\n\r\nAs a Service, we are revising our strat\xadegy from not only treating cases but detecting them early and aggressively pursuing their contacts to give them prophylaxis; a single-dose drug called rifampicin which has about 60 percent effectiveness against leprosy, to break the chain of transmission,” Programme Manager of the National Lep\xadrosy Control Programme, Dr. Benedict Okoe Quao, disclosed in an interview with the Ghanaian Times yesterday ahead of World Leprosy Day (WLD).\n\r\nHe said all 16 regions of Ghana were endemic for leprosy although the Upper East and Upper West regions, recorded the highest number of cases each year.\n\r\nDr. Quao said, the long incubation period for leprosy; from two to 20 years, made it possible for one to have the infection and not know until lesions and patches begin developing on the skin.\n\r\nHowever, he said, once people reported immediately to the health facility any anoma\xadly on the skin, early diagnosis could be made and one could be treated and cured of lepro\xadsy within six months or up to a year.\n\r\n“The disease starts on the skin; usually 99 per cent of cases. You will see light-coloured or red patches like ringworm on the skin if you have pale or reddish patches or anything lighter than the colour of your skin, itchiness of a lesion but you have no sensation in it, numbness of hand or feet, weakness of hands, eyelids and toes, swellings, a wound but you can’t feel it, you could suspect leprosy.”\n\r\nThe Programme Manager noted that the clawed fingers or toes, deformity or disabili\xadties often associated with persons diagnosed with leprosy occur when the infection has reached an advanced stage.\n\r\n“When we are able to diagnose early, we can treat and no one will know you ever had leprosy and that is what we are pushing for so that, people don’t end up with disability and not transmit the bacteria.”\n\r\n“We are aiming that by the WHO 2030 target, we would have reduced child cases of leprosy by 90 per cent, reduce new cases by 70 per cent and have a 90 per cent reduction in people advancing to grade 2 disability by 2030,” he added.\n\r\nWhile advising people to report immedi\xadately to the health facility any skin condition, Dr. Quao entreated the public to desist from stigmatising and discriminating against per\xadsons diagnosed with leprosy.\n\r\n“Let’s treat them with respect and dignity. Leprosy is not contagious, you don’t get it from touching or sharing objects. It is mainly through coming into contact with droplets from someone who has leprosy but has not been treated, either through cough, sneezing, talking, etc.\n\r\nPeople with deformities and the clawed fingers we point to as lepers are actually cured of the disease but the gentleman in suit sitting by you in the office, on the bus, etc, who may have a patch under his shirt, coughing and singing loudly is where you can pick the infection from, you go into incubation and the disease manifests years later,” he stated.\n\r\nThe Programme Manager called for increased investment toward eliminating leprosy as a public health problem in Ghana adding that; “leprosy is treatable and cur\xadable.”\n\r\nObserved every last Sunday in January to increase public awareness of leprosy and reduce its associated stigma, this year’s WLD is on the theme; “Act Now, End Leprosy.”\n\r\nLeprosy also known as “Hansen’s Dis\xadease” is an infection caused by a bacteria called mycobacterium leprae mostly affecting the nerves, skin, eyes and lining of the nose.",
    "Research by Send Ghana, a policy research and advocacy civil society, has revealed weaknesses in budget credibility for immunization in the country. The trend, which it says has a negative impact on immunization services in the country, was attributed to delays in the allocation and release of funds.\n\r\nSenior Programmes Officer of Send Ghana, Harriet Nuamah Agyemang, who revealed this at a National Stakeholders Dialogue on its Monitoring findings in Accra said the government is reneging on the commitment to immunization and challenged the Ministry of Finance to create a separate budget line purposely for the allocation of funds for immunization.\n\r\nSend Ghana, is a policy research and advocacy civil society organization supporting the grassroots with skills to hold public officers accountable. Together with its partners such as UNICEF and International Budget Partnership, the monitoring was carried out in five districts. This included Asuogyaman, Ho, Shai -Osudoku, Tatale/ Sanguli and Kassena Nankana and the Ghana Health Service at the national level to assess the financial commitments for immunization. The research hinged on thematic areas such as adequacy of allocation, adequacy of receipts, timeliness of release and disbursement of funds. Senior programs Officer, Send Ghana, Harriet Nuamah Agyemang, said the government should deliberately increase allocation and release funds as Ghana prepares to wean itself off donor support. She said in doing so, the government will uphold budget credibility.\n\r\nMadam Nuamah Agyeman said although Ghana is doing well with 98 percent coverage which even surpasses the international benchmark, there is more work to be done.\n\r\nSocial Policy Specialist UNICEF Ghana, Charles Dzradosi, was worried about over-expenditure in some sectors at the detriment of immunization. He asked the government to focus its energies on finding out what is causing such development.\n\r\nRoutine immunization is one key health intervention to avoid preventable diseases globally. It is the reason ‘Send Ghana’ and its partners want the government to commit more finances to ensure the well-being of citizens.",
    "For a lot of rape victims getting justice is a distant mirage.\n\r\nWith 40 cases of sexual assault reported daily in Ghana, rape victims are required to pay between GHC300 and GHC800 for a forensic medical examination.\n\r\nThe medical forensic exam, often called a rape kit, helps assess a victim’s health needs. \n\r\nThis documentation is also necessary to launch criminal investigations by providing evidence of injuries and other indicators of force or coercion against a victim.\n\r\nThe rape kits can also help establish the identity of the offender through DNA samples. \n\r\nBut for many victims, this fee is prohibitive, yet, without it, justice remains elusive, therefore, a group of Ghanaian professional ladies, based in the Netherlands, Perfect Ladies International has called on the government to scrap it.\n\r\n“A lot of people cannot afford this fee and so they desist from reporting the case altogether, it must be scrapped “ the leader of the group, Naa Joormo Akua Dedaa I, Queen mother of Kuntunse, said.\n\r\nThe group is partnering with the crime prevention organization, Crime Check Foundation to sensitize the public on rape and sexual violence.\n\r\nAccording to the UN children’s agency, UNICEF, at least 120 million girls under the age of 20 — about 1 in 10 – have been forced to engage in sex or perform other sexual acts (and the actual figure is likely much higher). \n\r\nThe group donated 16000 euros an equivalent of GHC21,000 to kick start the advocacy project.\n\r\nReceiving the cash donation, the Executive Director of Crime Check Foundation, Ibrahim Oppong Kwarteng pointed out a few factors that lead to underreported cases of sexual violence.\n\r\nAccording to him, the police often lack the capacity for thorough investigations, which can take years to reach a court. \n\r\nHe acknowledged that some community leaders often agree to quick, out-of-court settlements to avoid draining the meager savings of victims and their families.\n\r\n“We must not encourage that” he noted.\n\r\nPerfect Ladies International has been in existence for the past 5 years.  \n\r\nThe group focuses on social issues relating to women and girls.",
    "There is simmering tension in the Private Health Insurance industry following the incorporation and subsequent operations by the Ghana Association of Bankers (GAB) Health Insurance Scheme.\n\r\nSome players in the sector have expressed their disquiet over what they say is the unfair trade activities by GAB which could potentially affect the structure and future of Private Health Insurance (PHI) in Ghana.\n\r\nAccording to some of the affected schemes, GAB as a prerequisite to obtaining a license had agreed even if verbally, not to go after banks already doing business with existing schemes, something they say GAB has flouted.\n\r\nA member of the Private Health Insurance Oversight Committee of the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) and a spokesperson of the Private Health Insurance Association, Ronald Oppong Adom, in an interview says while the Association is open to business participation from all quarters, schemes that purport to operate in the name of unions could spell doom for the industry.\n\r\nEven more worrying, he averred, is the potential for these unionized schemes to coerce members of the union to stop doing business with existing companies so they can join the union’s schemes.\n\r\nWhile he does not contest the legality of GAB, Mr Adom believes the regulators, the National Health Insurance Authority, must ensure that the health insurance sector is not controlled by other sectors.\n\r\n“I think the concerns that PHIs have raised is the level of coercion that some banks that used to be members or that are members of existing PHI companies have been coerced to join the GAB health insurance company.\n\r\n“In a free market economy, the factors of demand and supply must be allowed to play without any strings attached but per the concerns which the members have shared, some of their clients have been pursued,” he stated.\n\r\nHe added: “What will happen if all the thriving associations put together a health scheme and coerce all their members to join their scheme? Let’s say the Telcos tomorrow put together a Health Insurance Company and say all telcos must belong to the health insurance company and go ahead to say that now they are distributing their health insurance company through their channels….When that happens the Private Health Insurance space will be controlled by another sector. For any sector to thrive, that sector should not be controlled by another sector. If that sector is controlled by another sector it becomes an issue.”\n\n\n Metropolitan Position  \n\r\nCEO of Metropolitan Health Insurance, Emmanuel Oteng, who has lost a number of banks to GAB, suspects foul play with the bankers association scheme.\n\r\nAccording to him, most of his clients who are bankers have been deliberately targeted by GAB.\n\r\n“They started and picked some few banks that had no insurance. It was a good thing initially because we have been pushing some of these banks that are uninsured to get on board so we thought when GAB entered the market it was an opportunity to grow the industry. But I think the attempt was deliberately to focus on the banks that already had insurance companies. We have flagged this as a risk because even though the regulator told them not to coerce clients to join them we knew it was going to happen,” he stated.\n\r\nAccording to him, the banks constitute the largest chunk of his clientele for which reason the activities of GAB should be looked at again. \n\n GAB no response  \n\r\nAttempts to get GAB to respond to the concerns raised by some of the industry players proved futile.\n\r\nBut the NHIA is convinced nothing untoward has happened.\n\r\nHudu Issah, the Director in charge of Private Health Insurance at the NHIA said by law the NHIA cannot stop GAB from operating.\n\r\nWhat it can do is ensure they operate fairly within the space they have decided to do business.\n\r\nHe also challenged the aggrieved companies to provide evidence of wrongdoing by the GAB so the NHIA can address it.\n\r\n“A few of them have reported that GAB is forcing some banks to leave them and join GAB. Petition the regulator, and add evidence. Until anyone is ready to bring a petition and attach evidence, the regulator cannot move,” he stated.\n\r\nHe added, “I don’t think they have anything to worry about. Insurance thrives on numbers but not all the time.\n\r\n“There are some numbers which will imply you made an adverse selection which will erode your gains. Banks are high-risk clients so if they are running from you, why worry?”",

    "Mr Ignatius Baffour-Awuah, the Minister of Employment and Labour Relations, Tuesday launched a Post-COVID Skills Development and Productivity Enhancement Programme (PSDPEP).  \n\r\nThe PSDPEP is a five-year project, which seeks to build health-related skills in higher education, restore livelihoods, strengthen public communication, and create jobs among the youth and women. \n\r\nIt is also aimed at promoting technical and entrepreneurship for job creation. \n\r\nThe project is being funded from a grant facility of US $31.34 million, comprising $28.5million from the African Development Bank (AfDB), and 2.8 million from Government of Ghana. \n\r\nThe Minister said the project was in line with critical government development policy frameworks, such as the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda, Government Coordinated Program of Economic and Social Development as well as the Country Strategy Paper (2019-2013). \n\r\nThis reflects the development aspirations of the Government of Ghana as required by the 1992 constitution. \n\r\nThe\u202fPSDPEP beneficiaries are: the\u202fGhana News Agency, Social Investment Fund, Microfinance and Small Loans Centre, the Biotechnology Centre, the School of Nursing and Midwifery, and the Microbiology Centre. \n\r\n\u202fThe rest are the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection, the Environmental Protection Agency,\u202fand\u202fthe National Vocational Training\u202fInstitute. \n\r\nThe project will be implemented in seven regions in Ghana – Greater Accra, Ashanti, Eastern, Bono, Northern, Central, and Upper West. \n\r\nMr Baffour-Awuah stressed the need for beneficiaries to own the project by mainstreaming it into their programmes. \n\r\nThat, he said, was necessary for its successful implementation. \n\r\nMr Kofi Frimpong, the Executive Director of the Social Investment Fund and Project Coordinator, indicated that the pandemic disrupted livelihoods at the individual, household and entrepreneurial levels due to lockdowns. \n\r\nThe project, he said, would, therefore, help to alleviate the plight of those affected.     \n\r\nMr. Emmanuel Fordjour, Desk Head of AFDB at the Ministry of Finance, said the Bank was committed to assisting Ghana to recover from the hardships the people suffered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\r\nSteering and technical committees were inaugurated before the programme launched to supervise its successful implementation.",

    "In the new Constitutional Instrument (CI) the Electoral Commission (CI) has expressed the intention of using the Ghana Card or ECOWAS Card, as the only form of identification or medium to qualify a citizen of Ghana who is legible to vote to registered or enrolled onto the voters’ register. \n\r\nThe pre-laying debate generated a heated debate between the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) Parliamentary Minority and the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) Majority with the former arguing against it while the latter was in support of it.  \n\r\nThe report of the Special Budget Committee, which is chaired by Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu, the Majority Leader and Leader of Government Business in Parliament, reiterated the Committee’s support for any effort that would enable every Ghanaian to get a Ghana Card because it was the Law. \n\n\r\nIt emphasised that the Committee had no objections against the EC using the NIA to embark on the registration of eligible voters. \n\r\n“However, the Committee would like to stress that, it will not accept and would reject any effort that is geared towards making the EC use the Ghana Card as the only medium to qualify a person who is eligible to vote in 2024 elections,” the report said. \n\r\n“This is premised on the fact that, indeed, Ghana has come of age and can boast of a credible national identification card (Ghana Card) to transact business with. \n\r\n“However, even in the face of a number of identification options given in the past, and even in the operation of the NIA, some citizens are unable to register for the national card due to the existence of serious challenges the Authority is confronted with,” according to the report.\n\n\r\nThe report said it was clear that until the challenges confronting the issuance of the Ghana Card were dealt with, using the Ghana Card as the only medium of voter registration, would negatively impact on the electoral roll and thereby, deny otherwise qualified persons from registering to vote. \n\r\nSpeaker Alban Sumana Kingsford Bagbin said the purpose of the exercise was to get the House to build a consensus on the issue. \n\n\r\nKyei-Mensah-Bonsu argued that the Majority side was in favour of the adoption of the motion by the House. \n\r\nHe reiterated that the EC was an independent constitutional body which nobody could obstruct from performing its constitutional mandate. \n\r\nHe said the concern of the House must be to ensure that no qualified Ghanaian was disenfranchised. \n\r\n“But Mr Speaker, let me note that the Electoral Commission cannot be prevented from presenting its CI, however, we must work together to ensure that the right thing is done,” Kyei Mensah Bonsu stated.\n\r\nAt the end of the debate the Motion was adopted by the House. \n\r\nAfter the adoption of the report of the Committee of the House, a closed-door meeting with the EC and NIA was held on how they intend to address issues raised in the report. \n\r\nThe National Democratic Congress (NDC) Minority Leader, Cassiel Ato Baah Forson,  backed by his immediate predecessor Iddrisu Haruna, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tamale South, raised concerns about the EC’s decision to make the Ghana Card the sole document for voter registration and why the electoral body wanted to limit voter registration to its district offices. \n\r\nIddrisu said the Minority were of the view that a lot of Ghanaians through no fault of theirs were not captured by the National Identification Authority (NIA) and, therefore, using the Ghana Card as the sole source document for voter registration would disenfranchise them.",

The second condition is that, yes, we are willing to take our share of responsibility as one of the major bilateral donors to Ghana.\n\r\n“But only if all the others also join in this effort. And there is a multilateral framework that was set up exactly for these kind of crisis and we urge and try to convince all stakeholders in this process to stick to this agreed framework. It’s the G 20 framework,” he said.\n\r\nWhen asked to lay out the terms of the domestic conditions to be met by Ghana, Daniel Krull indicated that, "Let me let me point to three elements. The biggest loss maker in Ghana is the energy sector. This in this sector alone, each year, 1.5 billion new debt is piled up. So if that is not solved and you can ask the IMF for $10 Billion, you still will not solve the problem in the medium term.\n\r\n“So there has to be an answer in Ghana to the 50% technical and non-technical losses in the energy sector. If that is not resolved, I don’t see how we can make find a sustainable solution for the financial problems of the country”.\n\r\nHe added, “the second part is on the other side of the budget and that is the the revenues. Ghana has the lowest one of the lowest tax to GDP ratios, not even 13%. So we have been cooperating with the local authorities and setting up a very smart system of property tax collection. So I think that is an important way forward and this has to be done and processes and decision making has to faster to meet the goals, to be able to meet the targets that have been agreed with the IMF”.\n\r\nThe Ambassador also noted that he’s still amazed on the procedures for how the budget is set up and how difficult it is to get an understanding of how this all works and he thinks that is something that has to be (Improved) approved.\n\r\nHe is however confident that with the necessary political will new opportunities will be created to enhance economic growth.”',

Today we have even learnt that you have to find out about the interest of land before you lease it out."\n\r\n"We have also learnt that because you agreed on the number of years you will lease out the land, you need to know about what the land will be used for and that will inform your decision on the years you will lease it out for.

    'A policy analyst, Steve Manteaw, has disclosed that the price stability at fuel stations in the country cannot be linked to the gold for oil programme introduced by the government.\n\r\nHe indicated that the price reduction of fuel isn’t predicated on anything the government may potentially be doing, as it will reduce on the \'basis of the free interaction of market forces\'. He however expressed concern that the process of the gold for oil policy by government is rather likely to cause a reversal of the country’s deregulation policy which could lead to market distortion.\n\r\nHe explained that "I hear about prices coming down as a result of this intervention. Let us know that so far, we’ve had only one consignment, which was actually about 10% or so of total monthly consumption, yet our fuel prices have been stable. So, nobody can attribute the stability of fuel prices at the pumps to the gold-for-oil."\n\r\nElaborating on the distortion likely to be caused as a result of the gold for oil, Manteaw explained that this is so because there is a situation where the government brings in these petroleum products after it has already indicated that not all Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) will be eligible to distribute.\n\n\r\n"So, you are going to select eligible and non-eligible OMCs, thereby interfering in the market in terms of competition and distorting the entire free market. So, it raises some fundamental questions as to whether we’re still committed to deregulation, or we want the market forces to determine what we pay at pump. Because government has indicated how it’s going to price the petroleum product on the local market", he said.\n\n\r\nSteve Manteaw further questioned why the government would choose to indicate how it’s going to price the petroleum product on the local market but refuse to tell the public the pricing policy on the international market, where it will acquire the petroleum product.\n\r\nHighlighting his reservations concerning the programme, he stated that his major concern has to do with the corruption risk associated with the programme which can be cured through disclosures and accountability in the entire transaction chain. He however explained that apart from headline statements, he is yet to see a full and well thought-out policy that is guiding the initiative.\n\r\nThe policy analyst conceded that although he has seen the implementation framework, that in itself has been inconsistent. He opined that an earlier implementation framework that was issued by the National Petroleum Authority treated the whole transaction as a barter.\n\r\nSubsequently, he highlighted that another implementation framework surfaced, which was issued by the Precious Minerals Marketing Company (PMMC), which then introduced a \'layer of a situation where government may have to pay cash\' for the petroleum product purchases.\n\r\n"So, there’s been two variants. I think as we move along, the implementers or designers of this programme are trying to adjust the framework as we move along, which also indicates that we haven’t really engaged, we haven’t thought through properly, and we haven’t addressed all the risks that may be associated with this transaction," he stated.\xa0\n\r\nFurthermore, the policy analyst expressed his misgivings about the purchase of gold from the domestic market entrusted to the Precious Minerals Marketing Company (PMMC). He noted that there’s been an ongoing programme initiated by Bank of Ghana on its own volition to shore up forex exchange reserve. However, he explained that in the latter part of 2022, the government introduced the gold-for-oil programme on the back of the ongoing programme by the Bank of Ghana.\n\r\nTo this end, Steve Manteaw highlighted that PMMC is being made the exclusive buyer of all domestic gold products including those from the community mining under the programme. Owing to this, he revealed that if PMMC is going to buy gold, it will need money of which information hasn’t been made available as to where it will get it from.\n\r\n"We’ve looked into the budget; no money has been allocated to PMMC for the purchase of gold. So, we are still in doubt as to how we are going to come by the money to purchase the gold. The risk here is that, if we are not careful, government can proceed to print money to finance the gold purchases. So, we need clarity on that… When it comes to cocoa purchases, we are clear; raise syndicated loans to finance the local purchases. But in this particular instance, we are not clear", he explained.\n\r\nManteaw further expressed that he expected the financing arrangement for the gold purchase to have been provided for in the budget. As a result of that not happening, he noted that stakeholders are still unsure and in doubt since PMMC is buying the gold on behalf of government, and there’s a need for clarity on the matter.',

The sad aspect of this illegality is that Nana Ette Akrade II, who claims to be a crusader against illegal mining activities in Gwira Traditional Area, is silent about the situation, the investigation has revealed\n\r\nThe current state of the river Ankobra is that it has been polluted by the illegal small scale mining activities, which evidence contradicts the clean state of the river claimed recently by the Deputy Minister of Lands and Natural Resources, Mr. George Mireku Duker who led the delegation of government appointees in the persons of Western Regional Acting Boss of the Minerals Commission, Mr. Francis Annobil and DCE for Ellembelle, Mr Kwasi Bonzoh on Thursday February 16 2023, to tour the river Ankobra.\n\r\nHowever the residents blasted the chief for making u-turn to ban illegal small scale mining activities in his community after join Mr, Duker, Paramount Chief of Gwira, Awulae Angama Tu-Agyan II and Chief of Gwira Abelebu, Nana Dominle Mieza II, including other chiefs to publicly attack the Managing Director (MD) of Okoben Mining Mining Company Limited, Nana Okoben Amponsah.\n\r\nThe residents asserted that Nana Ette Akrade II also supported the claimed by Mr. Duker who was accompanied in his tour of Ankobra River by the Western Regional Acting Boss of the Minerals Commission, Mr. Francis Annobil and DCE for Ellembelle, Mr Kwasi Bonzoh on Thursday February 16 2023 who noted that the return of the Ankobra River and other water-bodies to their pure status is a reflection of the strides made by government’s fight against illegal mining.\n\r\nHowever, the the illegal miners living in Gwira Banso who are from Mali Niger China and Ghana has who got wind of the information of banning of the illegal small scale mining activities in the area got furious and descended heavily on the chief.\n\r\nThe miners, according to the sources were not in support of the ideal and decision of the chief to ban their illegal small scale mining activities.\n\r\nThe miners were reported to have expressed disappointment at the chief saying that they could not fathom why the chief has taken such inhumane decision since the chief has allegedly collected an amount of GH¢1000 as Banso community living fee from each of the illegal miner before allowing them to operate in his community.\n\r\nAccording to them, the chief also charged them (illegal small scale miners) 20% on the gold resources mined on his land",
    "Scores of traditional office holders in the Gwira Traditional Area of the Evalue-Ajomoro-Gwira Municipality of the Western Region have berated government appointees in the mining regulatory institutions led by the Deputy Minister of Lands and Natural Resources Minister responsible for Mines, warning them to stop throwing dust onto the face of Ghanaians and the President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo that the Ankobra River is fast regaining its authentic and clean status.\n\n\r\nThe leaders in the catchment communities of River Ankobra stressed that the pollution of the Ankobra River which passes through the Ellembelle District and the Nzema East Municipality has worsened following a surge in illegal mining activities along the stretch.\n\r\nThey pointed out that the aerial photographs of the river on Thursday February 16, 2023 show that illegal miners are having a field day as the colour of the river has changed from its natural state to yellow.\n\r\nAccording to them, the residents of the Ankobra community located on the river banks are unable to use the water for domestic activities due to its current state.\n\n\r\nThey added that the Ankobra Beach Resort which is also located not too far from where the Ankobra River estuary, is likely not to attract tourists who usually come for surfing when the country’s borders are finally opened.\n\r\nThis, according to them, is because the polluted river Ankobra enters into what used to be a beautiful Ankobra Beach Resort.\n\r\nDuker who was accompanied on his tour of Ankobra River by the Western Regional Acting Boss of the Minerals Commission, Francis Annobil and DCE for Ellembelle, Kwasi Bonzoh on Thursday February 16 2023, noted that the return of the Ankobra River and other water-bodies to their pure status is a reflection of the strides made by government’s fight against illegal mining.\n\r\nAccording to him, the progress made in the turbidity level of the water bodies is indicative of the fact that the anti-galamsey fight is yielding results.\n\r\nWhile commending the various agencies and Ghanaians for their efforts, he maintained that government will not take its foot off pedal and will press on with the measures that have resulted in the gains made so far.\n\r\nBut in a quick response at a press conference on Friday February 17, 2023, the Tufuhene of Assuawuah in the Gwira Traditional Area, Nana Addae Blay V described the statement made by Mr. Duker who doubles as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tarkwa Nsuaem Constituency and his followers as untrue and called on President Akufo-Addo and many Ghanaians to disregard the mischievous public statements made by Mr. Duker and his followers.\n\r\nNana Addae Blay V further called on President Akufo-Addo to be mindful of his appointees, particularly the ones running administrative affairs of the state mining regulatory institutions.\n\r\nAccording to him, they were shocked to hear the news that the whole Deputy Minister of Lands and Natural Resources responsible for mining would tout to the whole nation that the River Ankobra which has currently changed it yellowish colour to green is now gaining its natural cleaning status, “asking that what kind of lies Dr Duker and followers are throwing into the public domain.?”\n\r\nHe mentioned that the current lies being perpetrated the personalities had attested to the fact that President’s appointees in the mining regulatory institutions had failed to discharge their works and that they are not helping the President to success in his quest to fight against the old aged canker in the mining prone communities of the Western Region.\n\r\nAccording to the him, the heavy mercury content in the river Ankobra from spices to sea continues to show no sign of reducing, saying that the claim by Duker and his followers were a face serving exercise to create the impression that they are working to help President Akufo-Addo.\n\r\n“I am stating categorically that the high rate at which the illegal small scale mining activities are going in the various communities such as  Sefwi Asawinso, Diaso, Wassa Jokwaa, Wassa Akropong, Hiawa Bekwai, Prestea, Pepoase, Gwira Wiaso Gwira Tumantu, Gwira Banso and Assuawuah is worrying.

    "Teachers at the Tsledom M/A Basic school in the Lower Manya Krobo Municipal of the Eastern Region can now heave a sigh of relief over their age-old accommodation challenges, thanks to the benevolence of Miss Mercy Tettey, an Australia-based Ghanaian philanthropist and missionary who has come to their rescue.\n\r\nThe school established in 1974 had to contend with accommodation challenges over the past 49 years without a befitting housing for its teaching staff.\n\r\nGhanaWeb in a February 16, 2022 publication noted that the teachers, due to the lack of accommodation were forced on a daily basis to ply several kilometers through a dusty, deplorable, and rocky mountainous road to reach the community to teach.\n\r\nThe publication also highlighted the lack of teachers to handle academic activities at the school.\n\r\nAs part of her efforts to contribute her quota to national development, the philanthropist on Friday, commissioned a 9-unit accommodation facility to address the accommodation problems of the teaching staff who had to commute on a daily basis to and from school.\n\r\nThe project which took three years to put up is fitted with solar panels to enable the teachers access light as well as use basic electrical gadgets.\n\r\nThat was not all, she also donated a 50-inch Sony television set to the school for educational and recreational purposes.\n\r\nThis is not the first time the missionary is coming to the aid of the people of Tsledom. In 2019, she provided a GhC 17,000 borehole facility for the community.\n\r\nMercy Tettey explained that the plight of the teachers touched her heart compelling her to raise personal resources to put up a comfortable place of abode for them.\n\r\nAccording to her, it was imperative for teachers to have a decent accommodation facility to complement their efforts towards providing tuition for the students.\n\r\n“I have heard that now the education is free so if the education is free now and the teachers are having problem for where they’ll sleep to teach the children then it is my duty to also provide them with some place to sleep so that they can teach our children free,” she said.\n\r\nThe missionary expressed hope that the provision of the facility would encourage more teachers to accept postings to the rural area to teach the students.\n\r\n “It is not easy to stay in the village to teach people so this one will motivate the teachers, when they post them here, they’ll come and teach,” she noted.\n\r\nMercy Tetteh was hopeful of extending further support to other deprived communities in the near future and expressed her readiness to do so when the need arises.\n\r\nShe urged the teachers to put in their best for the pupils and encouraged the pupils to also study hard to become responsible adults.\n\r\nMunicipal Director of Education, Samuel Tettey commended the headmaster and students for their resilience and sacrifices to teach the children and record excellent grades in the annual BECE even in the face of the harsh conditions that pertained such as accommodation and lack of teachers.\n\r\nAccording to him, the education directorate under his strenuous leadership familiarised himself with the various schools in the municipality to appreciate the challenges confronting the schools.\n\r\nHe commended Mercy Tettey on her exemplary works to contribute her quota to education in the country as according to him, government alone could not shoulder the burden of education, adding that her benevolence would in the end ensure that the students received sound education from their teachers.\n\r\nSamuel Tettey admitted that the school lacked enough teachers but assured the headmaster and the community that enough teachers would be deployed to the school as soon as new postings were made to the district.\n\r\nThe municipal education director however urged the teachers to ensure a good maintenance culture of the new facility to ensure that it lasts long to serve its purpose.\n\r\nHe commended the former School Help Education Programme (SHEP) Coordinator for Lower Manya Krobo and now Eastern Regional Coordinator, Godfred Ofoe Caesar for his tremendous support towards the school and the community at large.\n\r\nThe director received the keys of the building from Mercy Tetteh who also handed it over to the headmaster of the school, David Kofi Teye.\n\r\nOn his part, the Municipal Chief Executive (MCE) for Lower Manya Krobo, Simon Kweku Tetteh proposed the establishment of a special incentive package in collaboration with the education directorate to persuade teachers to accept postings to the school.\n\r\nHe reiterated president Akuffo-Addo’s commitment to education in the country through the implementation of the free SHS policy.\n\r\nStressing on government’s commitment to education in the country, the Assembly chief while noting that educational infrastructure was being rolled out across the municipal said government was doing its part to ensure that adequate infrastructure was provided for the sector.\n\r\nMr. Tetteh noted that teachers played a vital role in the development of their communities, hence, the need to motivate them by providing shelter over their heads as befitting accommodation would help improve teaching and learning, and also improve selflessness among the staff.\n\r\nThe MCE also promised to provide school uniforms for the students and encouraged them to take their studies seriously.\n\r\nHeadmaster of the school, David Kofi Teye while reiterating the difficulties teachers went through said the school nevertheless boasted of sterling performances in various sports and academic activities, scoring 100% BECE passes between 2016 and 2020.\n\r\nUnfortunately, he said the exodus of some of its teachers in 2020 to undertake further studies leaving only two teachers to handle teaching activities affected its output in the 2021 exams, dropping from its 100% performance to 62.7%.\n\r\nHe therefore appealed to the Ghana Education Service to ensure that more teachers were sent to the school to help the school restore its enviable academic performance.\n\r\nThe headmaster on behalf of the staff, pupils and entire community presented a citation to Madam Tettey in gratitude of her commitment to the welfare of the school and entire Tsledom community.",

    'Speaker of Parliament Alban Bagbin has said elections and successful government changeovers are not the only determinants of a working democracy.\n\r\nAlthough Ghana has had eight successive elections and four government change-overs between the two major political parties (NPP and NDC), Bagbin’s view, the nation must focus on strengthening its democratic institutions “if we want to have a sustainable democracy.”\n\r\nSpeaking at the launch of the 30th anniversary celebration of parliamentary democracy in Ghana held in the Chamber of Parliament on Wednesday, 22nd February 2023, the Speaker paid tribute to his predecessors since the fourth republic was birthed.\n\r\nHe noted that past Speakers have been pivotal in strengthening the pillars of Ghana’s democracy through their contributions and sacrifices.\n\r\nHe reminded lawmakers that Ghana has been chosen to host the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) annual conference from 30th August to 6th September 2023.\n\r\nAccording to him, the choice of Ghana to host the conference in itself is proof of how the world sees and rates the nation’s parliamentary democracy.\n\r\nThe theme for the 30th anniversary celebration is “30 years of parliamentary democracy in the Fourth Republic: the journey thus far”.\n\r\nThe year-long celebration is being planned by a committee chaired by the Member of Parliament for Abuakwa South, Samuel Atta Akyea.\n\r\n"The celebration will zone the country into six. Programmes will be planned to suit the peculiarities of each of the six zones", Speaker Bagbin revealed.\n\r\nRead details of his address below:\n\r\nRemarks by the Rt. Hon. Alban Sumana Kingsford Bagbin, Speaker of Parliament, at the launch of the 30th anniversary celebration of parliamentary democracy in Ghana held in the Chamber of Parliament on Wednesday, 22nd February 2023\n\r\nThe Leadership of the House\n\r\nDeputy Speakers of Parliament\n\r\nHon. Members of Parliament\n\r\nThe Clerk to Parliament and Deputy Clerks\n\r\nMembers of the Diplomatic Corps\n\r\nThe Chief of Defense Staff\n\r\nCommanders of the Ghana Armed Forces\n\r\nStaff of the Parliamentary Service\n\r\nMembers of the Parliamentary Press Corps\n\r\nLadies and Gentlemen!\n\n\nIntroduction\n\r\nIt is with joy and a great sense of fulfillment that I stand here today, with the support of the elected representatives of our dear country, to launch the 30th anniversary of parliamentary democracy in Ghana under the Fourth Republic. We are this year observing the combined 30th anniversary of our Constitution, our Parliament, and our Fourth Republic. Dare I say that there is a fourth 30th anniversary that we celebrate this year; and that is the 30th anniversary of one Alban Sumana Kingsford Bagbin in parliamentary. It is always good to recognize and celebrate achievements: it serves as a tonic for revitalization and re-focusing. As Terrence E. Deal, the American author said, “Celebrations infuse life with passion and purpose. They summon the human spirit.”-\n\r\nI launch this anniversary with immense gratitude to the patriotic citizens of this country, both departed and alive, who made various sacrifices in order to berth our current democratic dispensation. There were the members of the Constituent Assembly who put together our constitution, our late former president, Flight Lieutenant Jerry John Rawlings, together with members of the Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC) which he led, whose commitment and steer proved invaluable contributions to the introduction of the Fourth Republic. So were there many other ardents of democracy of different political persuasions – too many to mention here – whose contributions cannot be ignored.\n\nOur journey to the Fourth Republic\n\r\nTo most of you today, the Fourth Republic remains very dear, and rightly so. How we got here is history to you. In 1960 we jettisoned the 1957 Constitution which was fashioned according to the Westminster model of parliamentary practice. We adopted our First Republican Constitution on 1st July 1960. We then had military interruption between 1966 and 1969. The Second Republic, which was ushered in in 1969 also got interrupted: that subsequently paved way for the Third Republic in 1979. In 1981, that was also truncated until 1992 when we had our Fourth Republican Constitution adopted through a referendum. It has been a journey of vicissitudes toward the peaceful democracy that we enjoy today.\n\nThe 30th anniversary celebration\n\r\nThe theme for the 30th anniversary celebration is “30 years of parliamentary democracy in the Fourth Republic: the journey thus far”. We have set up a planning committee chaired by the Member of Parliament for Abuakwa South, Hon. Samuel Atta Akyea to help navigate us through the celebrations. The activities of the committee would be coordinated by the Clerk to Parliament, Mr. Cyril Kwabena Oteng Nsiah. I will urge that we all reflect on the theme as the programme of activities for the celebration unfolds. I am confident that we will participate fully in all the activities that will be planned. The year-long celebration will zone the country into six. Programmes will be planned to suit the peculiarities of each of the six zones. I must say I am impressed with the preliminary work of the committee so far. In due course, this will be unveiled to all of you.\n\nRemembering the fore bearers of Ghana’s parliamentary democracy\n\r\nWe cannot launch the 30th anniversary of parliamentary democracy in Ghana without paying tribute to the past speakers of the Fourth Republic who have been pivotal in strengthening the pillars of democracy through their contributions and sacrifices. I will want to mention the following:\n\r\nRt. Hon. Daniel Francis Annan (late), the pioneering Speaker of the First Parliament of the Fourth Republic, who served from 7th January 1993 to 6th January 2001.\n\r\nRt. Hon. Peter Ala Adjetey (late), the Speaker of Parliament from the 7th January 2001 to the 6th January 2005.\n\r\nRt. Hon. Ebenezer Begyina Sekyi-Hughes was Speaker of Parliament from 7th January 2005 to 6th January 2009.\n\r\nRt. Hon. Justice Joyce Adelaide Bamford-Addo, who was the Speaker of Parliament from 7th January 2009 to 6th January 2013.\n\r\nRt. Hon. Edward Doe Adjaho was Speaker of Parliament from 7th January 2013 to 6th January 2017.\n\r\nMy immediate predecessor, the Rt. Hon. Professor Aaron Mike Oquaye, who took over as the Speaker of Parliament on 7th January 2017, and who I succeeded on 7th January 2021.\n\r\nThis makes yours truly, the Rt. Hon. Alban Sumana Kingsford Bagbin the 7th Speaker but of the 8th Parliament. The first Speaker served two consecutive terms in the first and second parliaments of this republic.\n\nThe Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference\n\r\nLet me take this opportunity to remind us all that the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) will hold its annual conference here in Accra. The tentative date is from 30th August to 6th September 2023. Selecting Ghana to host this prestigious conference in itself is an honour. Beyond that, it is proof of how the world sees and rates our parliamentary democracy. We have indeed come very far as a democratic country. We should keep this in mind as we prepare to host the CPA in Accra. Let us put our A Game on display in whatever role we are assigned so that at the end of the day, the CPA conference in Accra will leave lasting memories on the minds of participants.\n\nConclusion\n\r\nGhana has had eight successive elections and four government change-overs between the two major political parties. On account of that, we can confidently say that we are now a consummate democratic dispensation. However, elections and successful government changeovers are not the only determinants of a working democracy. We must focus on strengthening our democratic institutions if we want to have a sustainable democracy.\n\r\nHon. Leaders of the House, Hon Members of Parliament, the Clerk to Parliament and staff of the Parliamentary Service, distinguished guests, I wish to declare the 30th anniversary celebration of Ghana’s parliamentary democracy duly launched.',

But we are sorry to inform them that it is indeed true, that In Shaa Allah Lawyer Zankawah is coming and he shall prevail.\n\r\n"My intention to contest the forthcoming primaries was not borne out of sheer pursuit of popularity or recognition or crave for relevance, but it is borne out of a strong desire to salvage the constituency and put it back on track of real development pursued by previous NDC regimes," he said.\n\r\nThe Coordinator of NDC Lawyers in Savannah said  Damongo was the political and traditional capital of Gonjaland and with HE John Mahama as the President in waiting, cannot afford losing the seat one more time.\n\r\nHe recounted his past contributions to the party in the Damongo constituency and beyond, even after, he failed in his bid twice to become the DCE for West Gonja, pledging to run a clean campaign devoid of name calling and mudslinging, stressing that," I shall focus on mending the cracks and building bridges".\n\nBrief Profile of Lawyer Baba Sadique Zankawah\n\r\nLawyer Baba Sadique Zankawah comes into this contest as the proverbial ‘Kapok Tree’ whose roots and buttresses are deep and extensive, extending across the length and breadth of the Constituency and beyond. \r\nOriginally, he hails from Larabanga but born and bread in Canteen with ancestral roots in Ngbaripe-Damongo (specifically the Dua-pe Clan). His ancestral roots further extend to Busunu, Murugu, Mognori and even Daboya.\n\r\nLinguistically, he can be described as a polyglot who speaks Kamara, Gonja, Hanga, “Canteen Housa”, Wale/Dagaari, and Mampruli. He also understands and fairly speak Frafra, Dagbani, Twi among others.\n\r\nIn terms of education, Lawyer Baba Zankawah had his elementary education at Canteen L/A Primary/Middle School- Canteen; Secondary education at Damongo Secondary School,- Damongo; and attended several tertiary institutions including, the University Johannesburg, South Africa; University of Ghana, Lagon; Ghana Institute of Management and Public Administration; Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Ghana and the Ghana School of Law, Makola Accra. \n\r\nBy way of profession, he is a Barrister at Law (Barrister & Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Ghana) and a Radiographer, with expertise in several other areas. \n\nPolitical activism, affiliation and track record\n\r\nThe political activism and affiliation of Lawyer Baba Sadique Zankawah to the NDC dates back to the revolution era where as a teenager, he was an active member of the Democratic Youth League of Ghana (DYLG), the youth wing of the then committee for the Defence of the Revolution (CDR) and transitioned into the Varenda Boys and Girls, also a youth group in the early stages of the NDC.\n\r\nHe has been an unalloyed supporter and loyal member of the Party since 1992 and have contributed (financially, materially, and intellectually) to the course and wellbeing of the Party in Damongo constituency most especially, from 2007 till date.He actively supported and participated in every electioneering campaign since 2008. Very recently, he supported the Party with close to 300 plastic chairs. \n\r\nOver the period, he has served the lager party in some significant roles.\n\r\nHe is currently a member of and Secretary to the Savannah Regional Disciplinary Committee of the Party and also a member of the Savannah Regional Political and Strategy Committee.\r\nFurther, he is a member and the incumbent President of the Professional Forum of the NDC (Proforum), Savannah Regional Chapter and also member of the NDC Legal Team and Coordinator of the NDC Lawyers in the Savannah Region. \n\r\nIn the last regional executive elections, he served as a committee member of the National Vetting Committee and was assigned to the North East Region.\r\nHis relationship and dealings with individuals and Party have always been influenced solely by the overriding interest of the Party and not by my whims and caprices nor that of any other individual. \n\r\nHe has resisted many temptations and calls to contest the Damongo constituency seat knowing when we had an incumbent MP whom we all needed to keep supporting to retain the seat in the collective interest of the party. \n\r\nEven when he contested for the District Chief Executive on two consecutive times (in 2009 and 2013) but was unsuccessful on both occasions, he never became discouraged in my loyalty and support to the party. \n\r\nNot even when a petition was maliciously written against his DCE bid could shake his loyalty nor demotivate him from supporting the party. He continued to give off my very best of resources, support and physical presence over the period to ensure that the Damongo seat is always that of the NDC, but unfortunately, the party lost the seat in the 2020 elections to the NPP.',
    "Correspondence from Western Region\n\r\nA loud noise like an explosion was heard in the early hours of Wednesday at Bankyim a suburb of Tarkwa which was the result of two tipper trucks involved in an accident where one person was severely injured.\n\r\nOne of the tipper trucks with registration number GN 2106-22 belonging to Western Transport Services, Tarkwa was conveying manganese from Nsuta to Takoradi while the other truck with registration number GN-8954-18 was heading towards Tarkwa from Takoradi when the accident happened.\n\r\nThe truck belonging to Western Transport was heavily destroyed with blood spilling on the road.\n\r\nIn an interview with GhanaWeb’s Western Regional Correspondent, the driver heading towards Tarkwa, Nicholas Agyemang, said upon reaching Bankyim, near Tarkwa he realized that the driver of the Western Transport truck was veering off the road towards him.\n\r\n“I, therefore, decided to give him way by moving to the shoulder of the road towards the gutter, but he still came close and crushed into the bucket of my car. I suspect he was dozing off while driving that is how come this happened,” he added.\n\r\nA resident of Bankyim, Stephen Koffie noted that “it was the fault of the driver from Nsuta because he was sleeping at the same time while carrying heavy loads from Nsuta.\n\r\nThe driver was trapped in the car so the fire service had to cut and remove him from the car, we are even praying to God that he would not die because his leg was trapped in the car,” he narrated.\n\r\nHe explained that most of the time, accidents happen on that stretch, and need the attention of authorities construct speed humps there in order to reduce the rate of accidents there.\n\r\nAnother resident, Bright recalled another incident that happened around the same place where a truck went into a drug store and destroyed other stores and property.",
    "The Minister of State-designate at the Ministry of Local Government, Osei Bonsu Amoah (OB), on Tuesday offered perhaps the most solid defence yet of President Akufo-Addo’s oft-condemned elephant-sized government.\n\r\nOB says a dispassionate interrogation of the matter is needed rather than subjecting it to partisan treatment.\n\r\nThe Akwapim South MP believes it serves no good to just bandy numbers around and point to which government may have appointed the slimmest staff to prosecute its mandate versus which appointed the most people.\n\n\r\nAnd he laid down his cards with a dig into history, saying 'we have never been in the shoes of a president', echoing a personal touch to former President John Mahama’s famous retort of 'You have never been president before.\n\r\nAppearing before the Appointments Committee of Parliament to be vetted after his nomination as a Minister of State, OB Amoah was served a variety of questions, with the controversial government size and calls to reduce same coming up a couple of times.\n\r\nBut he argued that the government had already taken steps to collapse or merge a number of ministries, while it has also downsized ministerial appointments from about 126 to 85.\n\r\n“So it’s not like the president is not doing anything about it and it’s like, the way we put it, sometimes the statements become a bit sweeping,” he said, and pointed out that the President has further issued an edict to cut down on everything for appointees, including MMDCEs.\n\n\r\n“So it’s not that the President is not aware of the austerity or nothing has not been done (sic), some may wish to do it in a different way or different style and it’s not that we used to have it so rosy that we could have, let’s say six ministers of state and the famous three wise men, but as the constitution says, the president shall appoint persons to help manage the state, and if at any point in time the president feels that this is the number he can use to manage or run the state\"\n\r\n\"sometimes you have to give him the benefit of the doubt especially when we see that efforts have been made to cut down, and who knows, he may still cut down and I don’t think it should really be a major issue every time. Sometimes you get the impression that some people wish we even had only five ministries and that all our problems in Ghana will be solved but, we have never been in the shoes of a president, and in deed as I said, a lot has been done and a lot may still be done.”\n\r\nIn 2016 when John Mahama was president, he faced criticisms for perceived poor performance, he told off then presidential running-mate, Mahamudu Bawumia that he had no idea what competence was about because he had never been president before.",

    'Correspondence from Bono East Region\n\r\nMore than twenty communities in the Kintampo Municipality of the Bono East Region are without stable mobile connectivity.\n\r\nMobile connectivity is either non-existent or unreliable, making it difficult for residents in those communities to stay connected with the outside world, run businesses, or access important information.\n\r\nAlthough the Ghana Investment Fund for Electronic Communications (GIFEC) has extended mobile connectivity under the rural telephony programmme in the Municipality, some of the sites are not working effectively and have failed to achieve the intended purpose.\n\r\nCommunities including Ahanekom, Dabaa, Adomano, Miawani, Kobeda, Badu Akura, Ntraban, Tefoboi, Techira, Bewele, Kawampe, Korawura Akura, Kadelso, Abodwese, and Kaakaa all have a network challenge.\n\r\nThe Member of Parliament for the Kintampo North Constituency, Joseph Kwame Kumah, indicated that the network challenge is having a negative toll on the economic activities of the people. \n\r\nHe underscored the importance of communication as a tool for business, education, and health but limited access to modern communication technology in Kintampo North highlights the digital divide that still exists in many rural areas of Ghana and wants the government to intervene.\n\r\n“Communication has become a tool for even businesses and there are schools that need internet connectivity for teachers to research to effectively teach students but in some communities, there is no mobile connectivity at all whilst in others, the signal is weak so the government should get the technical people here to rectify the situation”.\n\r\nHe emphasised the urgent need for investment in infrastructure to bridge this gap and improve connectivity for all in line with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9 which aims to significantly increase access to ICT and strive to provide universal and affordable access to the internet in the least developed countries.\n\r\n“We are in the 21st century so there is the need to improve mobile connectivity by investing in infrastructure in the telecommunication industry to improve access and connectivity for all for the attainment of SDG 9”.\n\r\nSpeaking on how the mobile connectivity challenge is affecting them, a resident of Ahanekom, Kofi Opoku, disclosed that mobile connectivity is a major headache to them and they have grown increasingly frustrated with the lack of action from mobile service providers and the government.\n\r\n"We have been complaining about this issue for a long time, but nothing has been done. We are living in the 21st century, and yet we are cut off from the rest of the world."\n\r\nBomfeh Sidawa detailed the frustrations residents go through to make calls and appealed to the government to ensure that mobile connectivity is extended to the community.\n\r\n“I am from this Ahanekom and I can testify to the frustrations we go through to make calls to our loved ones and during emergencies so we are appealing to the government to come to our aid."',
    "Correspondence from Northern Region:\n\n\r\nInvestigations by GhanaWeb  have revealed that death cases at the Tamale Teaching Hospital are rising due to the absence of oxygen at the hospital. \n\r\nChecks at the teaching hospital indicate that at least five patients who needed oxygen support may have died between Saturday, February 18, and Sunday, February 19, alone. \n\r\nThe patients included emergency and critical surgery patients who needed urgent oxygen support. \n\r\nA relative of one of the deceased who spoke on condition of anonymity told GhanaWeb on Sunday that “my father needed oxygen support, he was in a critical condition, yet they kept telling us there was no oxygen. The old man died, while grasping for breath.”\n\r\n Another relative of a patient said doctors kept telling them they, as doctors, had nothing to do with the situation because it was the hospital's administration that was responsible for the current situation. \n\r\n“My brother  We have urgent, emergency and critical surgery cases, yet the Doctors are telling us there’s no oxygen. The doctors said hospital administration is responsible, yet they are not responding quickly. \n\r\n\"In my brother’s case, we were referred from Habanna Hospital yesterday with the indication that his surgery has to be as soon as the Ambulance took us there, because “every minute counts” quote from the doctor. It’s over 24hrs now, he is still lying there, not done,” the patient's relative said. \n\r\nEven though the Tamale Teaching Hospital has an oxygen plant, GhanaWeb's investigations revealed that the plant has been dysfunctional for some time now, leaving the hospital to rely on a private supplier in town. \n\r\nHowever, the supplier’s plant has also not been working for some time. \n\r\nA hospital source told GhanaWeb the situation was worrying because many people die at the TTH because of oxygen related issues. \n\r\nThe death, according to our source has normally been attributable to the lack of oxygen or the lack of oxygen filled mobile oxygen cylinders. \n\r\n“People die many needless deaths here. The deaths have normally been attributable to the lack of oxygen or the lack of oxygen filled mobile  oxygen cylinders” he said. \n\r\nMeanwhile management of the hospital has said it regrets the inconvenience the lack of oxygen supply has brought. \n\r\nA statement signed by Acting Chief Executive of the Hospital, Dr Atiku Adam on Monday February 20 said management has put in place two intervention strategies to see to the supply of oxygen to the hospital immediately by engaging the Tamale Central Hospital as well as augmenting of the capacity internal production unit.\n\r\n It assured that there will be optimal quantities of oxygen, hopefully by the close of work on Tuesday.\r\nRead the statement from the hospital below:",
    "The Upper East Regional chapter of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) has given government two weeks to either bring back the contractor working on the Bolga-Bawku road or risk seeing a riot of the people.\n\r\nThe leadership of the party held a press conference on 21st February 2023, at the party's Regional office in Bolgatanga. \n\r\nThe Party’s Regional Communication Officer, Jonathan Abdullah Salifu who read the presser indicated that they have given the government two weeks to either respond to their calls and bring back the contractor or risk seeing the people riot.\n\r\nHe said, “We believe that if president Akufo-Addo cuts down the needless expenditure through reduction of the size of his government, suspension of the needless National Cathedral project, and eschew the unbridled profligacy, it will make enough savings to complete essential projects such as the Bolgatanga-Bawku-Polimakom road, the Navrongo-Naaga road, the Chuchuliga-Sandema Fumbisi-Wiesi road, Missiga-Kulungungu road project among others.\n\r\n“Again, our sources within the construction firm indicate that about four hundred (400) workers on the project have been laid off. This gives credence to the fact that the Akufo-Addo/Bawumia-the led government have failed to honor its financial obligation to the contractors hence the reason they have abandoned site”, he stressed.  \n\r\nThe Upper East Regional NDC also noted the recent suspension of work by the contractor was due to the government's reckless borrowing, careless expenditure, and insatiable penchant for corruption that led to its inability to pay the contractor.\n\r\n“This government due to its reckless borrowing, careless expenditure, and insatiable penchant for corruption has led us all to this mess of economic quagmire. \n\r\n“The people of the upper east region cannot certainly be the sacrificial lamb for this ineptitude and incompetence.” \n\r\nQueiroz Galvao, the Brazilian contractor working on the Bolgatanga-Bawku-Pulmakom Road in the Upper East Region, has packed out of the site.  \n\r\nThe contractor in the early hours of Friday, 10 February 2023, packed all the firm's equipment and left the site without a word to his local workers.\n\r\nThough authorities including the Upper East Regional Director of the Ghana Road and Highways are yet to comment on the matter, a deep-throat source at the corridor of the department who spoke to Class 91.3 FM’s Upper East Regional Correspondent Moses Apiah attributed the contractor’s exit to government's failure to pay the contractor some arrears after several appeals.\n\r\n“It is not surprising that the contractor has packed out of site. The government refused to pay him despite numerous follow-ups.  So should he just be working for nothing? \n\r\n“How will he even pay for fuel for the machines? I was told he's going to a different country. But we wait to see a formal complaint from him through a letter\", the source said.\n\r\nHe added that: “The contractor has already exported some of his equipment to far away East Africa, and might not return. \n\r\n“We hope if the government is listening and really wants to complete this project, they will be able to pay the contractor. We wait to hear from him [contractor] [through] a formal letter as I said earlier.” \n\r\nThe project was expected to be completed in March 2023, according to Peter Dagadu, a consultant to the firm as work was around 44 percent complete somewhere in August 2022.\n\r\nThe 127-million Euro project began in 2016 and was expected to be completed in two-and-a-half years, but due to non-payment of arrears, the contractor withdrew his equipment from the site for about a year. \n\r\nHe was later brought back by the current administration in 2018 with a revised contract sum of 127 million euros against the preliminary contract sum of GHS613 million in 2016.\n\r\nThe project includes the construction of three new bridges at the Kulaa River at Bolga which was 30% complete, the Red Volta River at Tilli -80% complete, and the White Volta River at Kobore which was yet to start.",

In the face of this nagging reality and undesirable spectacle we have remained hopeful and resolute to fulfil our Constitutional mandate to the good people of this country,” he stated.\n\r\nHe noted that: “Court houses must be decent in every sense of the world, the working environment should not only be conducive to productivity but also reflect the authority and dignity of the rule of the judiciary.”\n\r\nHe indicated that the rule of law has been a key factor contributing to making Ghana an oasis of peace in West Africa.  \n\r\nJustice Anin-Yeboah said: “The culture of rule of law, has been a key factor of making our country an oasis of peace in the sub-region. \n\r\n“The indispensable contributions of the judiciary to the country’s robust constitutional democracy as well as the maintenance of peace and stability cannot be swept under the country.”\n\r\nHe further noted that the new court forms part of efforts by the Judicial Service to “make justice delivery accessible by all people.  \n\r\n“It is our resolve to build a system of justice that assures our litigants and countrymen of efficient, timely and quality justice delivery.”\n\r\nThe court will serve the people of the town and its environs. \n\r\nHe also called on staff of the judiciary who will be working in the facility to ensure the highest maintenance culture for both equipment and infrastructure.\n\r\n“I urge not only the assembly but also to our staff who will be working in this facility to ensure the highest maintenance culture for both the facility and the equipment therein. The radar should continually be on this facility and its operations so that the right thing is done at all times to prevent any financial loss to the state. “",

The dreadful impact of the conflict is especially aggravated on women and children as schools close down and health official flee the area.”\n\nBelow is the full statement:\n\r\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\r\nPlace: Issued in Accra\r\nDate: 21ST February, 2023\n\r\nTITLE: BAWKU CONFLICT MUST BE GIVEN URGENT NATIONAL ATTENTION\n\r\nThe Network of Women Mediators in Ghana, an affiliate of the Women Mediators Across The Commonwealth and the Global Alliance of Women Mediators Network has taken note of the deterioration of the Bawku Conflict.\n\n\r\nThe Network is concerned that the recent happenings threaten to further exacerbate the existing tensions in the community. The conflict has become a threat to state security and therefore requires urgent state led actions for peace and security to thrive.\n\r\nIt is quite clear that the conflict has taken a downward trend with much more complexities than before. We have noted that the people, especially the parties in the conflict are beginning to lose trust in the current response mechanisms, including the securitized strategies and the judicial interpretations to resolve this conflict.\n\r\nThe Network of Women Mediators in Ghana is deeply concerned about innocent lives lost in the Bawku conflict so far and its dire impact on the quality of life of all citizens in the area. The dreadful impact of the conflict is especially aggravated on women and children as schools close down and health official flee the area. About 27 pregnant women are reported to have died between 2021 and 2022 because health professionals have absconded the conflict area; the threat to the education of children, and the impact of livelihood of many citizens, especially on women has become a dire issue which requires Government urgent attention.\n\r\nConsidering all the above, the Network of Women Mediators in Ghana reiterate that the Bawku Conflict can no longer be described as a communal conflict. We are concerned that extremist groups can take advantage of the vulnerability created by the conflict resulting in a likely flow of violence from extremists groups across the border. Ghana risk the spread of violence to other parts of the country if urgent action is not taken to curb the violence in Bawku. Government of Ghana must therefore urgently come out with an official response to the crisis. The Network is calling on the parties in the conflict and the Government of Ghana to urgently take the following steps to restore peace to the area and prevent the situation from getting worse:\n\r\n1. All parties to the conflict must cease fire and commit to dialogue in search for collective solution for all stand to loose in a conflict like this.\n\r\n2. Government must initiate and support an inclusive political dialogue process that seeks the interests and needs of the affected people and the nation state of Ghana as a country.\n\r\n3. Urgently appoint a committee of eminent chiefs to lead the political dialogue with lessons from the Dagbon mediation process.\n\r\n4. The conflict has been politicized enough with no solution. Politicians should commit to work together in search of a lasting solution to the conflict, by committing to be part and actively participating in the political dialogue process.\n\r\n5. The Media must be circumspect in their reportage, as certain reportage only stirs emotions for parties in conflict to stick to their positions rather than listen to alternative ways of responding to situations. Media houses who cause further tensions through their reportage, such as false reportage should be sanctioned by state security agencies.\n\r\n6. Vulnerable groups especially women, children, elderly and persons with disability must be protected by the security agencies and both parties should commit to doing this as part of their commitment for a peaceful resolution of this as part of their commitment for a peaceful resolution of the conflict.\n\r\n7. We call on the national security apparatus to be proactive, use intelligence and early warning to prevent the conflict from getting worse. We reiterate our call for a state-led process to address the Bawku Conflict. The network of Women Mediators in Ghana consists of trained women mediators across Ghana. The group is affiliated to the Women Mediators in the Commonwealth.\n\r\nSigned by\n\r\nConveners:\r\nMrs. Theodora Williams Anti and Mrs. Janet Adama Mohammed",
    "The government of Ghana, through the newly established National Alternative Employment and Livelihood Programme (NAELP), has reclaimed over 1000 hectares of land from illegal miners in the Western North.\n\r\nDr. Carol Louise Donkor, the Programme’s National Coordinator, visited some of the areas managed by Dredge Masters, a subsidiary of the Jospong Group of Companies (JGC). The company has taken back 450 hectares of land in the Western North from illegal miners, known as Galamseyers.\n\r\nDr Donkor reiterated that The NAELP is aimed at alleviating the hardships of people adversely affected by the activities of illegal miners, and also as part of the government’s efforts to sanitise the mining space.\n\r\nThe programme also includes a community mining scheme which presents a module for small scale mining in the country.\n\r\nShe said the project will create jobs for over two thousand youths in the affected area through the replantation of the lands.\n\r\nIt was against this backdrop that Dredge Masters was contracted by the government in 2021 to help reclaim 414 hectares of galamsey lands in Asawinso A & B, Sefwi, Mepasem and Antobia all in the Western North Region.\n\r\nSpeaking to the media, the Project Manager for Dredge Masters, Ing. Bernard Asumeng Adjei Saw, said the project was 90% complete.\n\r\nHe disclosed that the company was awarded a contract to reclaim 414 hectares of illegal mining lands.\n\r\n“But as it stands now, we have even exceeded the total hectares that we needed to reclaim. We have now done about 450 hectares of in total.\n\r\nAccording to him, the land reclamation was part of other components of the project, stating that after that, his company will be moving to phase two of the project which is replanting trees on the reclaimed lands.\n\r\nIng Asumeng Saw commended the government for its efforts to reclaim lands damaged by illegal miners.\n\r\n“The government of Ghana has done a very good work. It has invested hugely to ensure that this damaged lands by Galamseyers are reclaimed and put to more productive use,” he expressed.\n\r\nHe, therefore, appealed to the chiefs in the Western North to support the government in ensuring that illegal miners do not return to these reclaimed lands.\n\r\nWhile pointing out some challenges militating against the project, the site manager of Dredge Masters, Gilbert Atima, asked that the various communities within the reclaimed lands be involved in the tree-planting phase of the project.\n\r\nFor his part, a Technical Officer for NALEP, Daniel Fordjour Agyemang, indicated that his outfit has a plan in place which will see the involvement of all stakeholders to ensure the sustainability of the economic tress that will be planted on the lands.\n\r\n“In no time, we will roll all this out for the community’s benefit,” he assured.\n\r\nThe Chairman of the Small Scale Miners in Juaboso, King George, said the programme has been beneficial to miners in the region.\n\r\nSome of the people working on the replanting project also talk about how helpful the project has been to them.",
    "Some suppliers who serve the Pantang hospital with hospital supplies like food and chemicals have ceased their services over the hospital’s debt of GHC 2.8m.\n\r\nAccording to Daily Graphic report, these suppliers have stopped delivering their services to the Pantang hospital for a year now and as of 2023, Pantang hospital has still not received any supplies from their clients.\n\r\nThe report added that the hospital owes close to 25 suppliers including Ghana Oil Limited (GOIL), Alliance Waste Limited and Auto Clinic.\n\r\nThese actions taken up by these suppliers have affected the modus operandi of the mental hospital.\n\r\nThe hospital's Medical Director, Dr. Frank Baning, explained that the Ministry of Health is aware of the ongoing issue and has also done their part by writing to the Ministry of Finance.\n\r\n“And so, the hospital has done as directed by its parent ministry and we are, therefore, hopeful that Finance Ministry will settle suppliers soon in order for them to resume their work efficiently”, he explained. \n\r\nDr. Frank Baning also disclosed some issues that are attributed to their debts. \n\r\nAccording to him, there are some laws that have made payment of hospital bills free to treated patients and this somehow hinders the hospital from getting money. \n\r\nThese laws include the Mental Health Act (Act 846) as well as a solicit appeal from the Commission of Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ).\n\r\nHe further stated that, with the Mental Health Act (Act 846), the law has made some of their health services free to a number of patients they treat. \n\r\nThe Medical Director for the hospital also addressed his concern about mental health services not being under the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and calls upon the government to treat this issue as an emergency.\n\r\nHe said, “We are appealing to the government to move mental health services under NHIS to reduce the financial burden on the national purse. Under the NHIS, we can make claims for every patient that seeks services at the facility.” \n\r\nED/OGB",

    "Correspondence from Bono Region\n\n\r\nTeachers at the Kanturo AME Zion Basic School in the Sunyani West Municipality of the Bono Region have made an urgent appeal for the construction of a staff bungalow to accommodate them.\n\r\nAccording to the teachers, the absence of a staff bungalow is impeding effective teaching and learning in the school as they have to commute mostly from Fiapre, Odumase, and Sunyani to Kanturo on daily basis. \n\r\nDue to the situation, teachers in the community contend that they normally report to school late as they go through a lot of stress getting a reliable source of transport to the community. \n\r\nNarrated their ordeals, the headteacher of the school, Michael Anyagre Afugu, bemoaned the stress and risks teachers go through daily to get to the community.\n\r\n“All the teachers in the school commute from outside the community because there is no staff bungalow here and the situation is negatively affecting both teachers and pupils.

    "Over three thousand traders, commercial drivers, and truck drivers who ply their trade at the Western Regional Market and lorry station in Agbogbloshie Market in Accra are on the verge of losing their sources of livelihood as the market is allegedly being taken over by the Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu Bawumia, for the construction of hostels and toilets for head porters (Kayayei) in Accra.\n\r\nThe foundation is currently being dug in more than half of the land in preparation for the start of the project.\n\r\nThe traders and drivers claim to have lived on that plot of land for over 40 years, only to arrive at work on Monday to discover that their properties on the land had been destroyed.\n\r\nFive vehicles stationed on the land at the time of the operation were towed to the Accra Metropolitan Assembly’s office (AMA).\n\r\nThe drivers claim they had to pay 5,000 Ghana cedis (GHc5,000) each before they were released.\n\r\nThey had no choice but to seek assistance from two of their members of parliament, Dorcas Afo Toffey for Jomoro and Emmanuel Armah Kofi Buah for Elembelle.\n\r\nMadam Afo Toffey explained to traders and drivers in Accra that when she received the call about their ejection without notification, she called the Greater Accra Regional Minister, Henry Quartey, who denied knowledge of the ejection.\n\r\nShe said the Minister told her the location is not under his jurisdiction, but rather that of Accra’s Mayor, Elizabeth Sackey. She assured them that what is happening to them is affecting her as well, and that she will do everything she can to get to the bottom of the problem, and that even if the land is taken, they will be relocated.\n\r\n“What the government wants to do by building a hostel and toilet on the land is not a bad idea,” Madam Afo Toffey said in Twi.\n\r\nShe stated that over 2000 women are trading on that parcel of land, and if such land is taken away from them, they will be unable to provide for their families, as women are the ones who take care of their homes.\n\r\n“If the government is doing such things for the Kayayei, then traders and drivers also need a befitting place to do their business and not to push them away”. She promised to meet with the Mayor of Accra to resolve the issue amicably.\n\r\nBrigadier-General Nana Adu, a retired Army officer and truck owner who operates at the station, said he does not understand why the government must take such action. He admitted that the government can take land for such development, but taking it by force is not the right way to go about it.\n\r\nHe said that there should have been a dialogue with the people for peace to reign. Brigadier-General Adu stated that an arrangement should have been made as to where the occupiers would be taken, but for the government to wait until Friday when the area is calm before storming in with police and military to take over is not the right way.\n\r\n“We know the army and the police are controlled by the government and so the moment these people came to take over the place for the construction of the project, we are convinced the government has a hand in it”.\n\r\nNational Secretary for Coconut Oil Dealers Association, J. B. Gbolor, called for an injunction on the project until the determination of the matter.\n\r\nHe said day in and day, the contractor is bringing construction equipment unto the lord which is not in their interest. The Chairman of the Drivers Union who gave his name as Life explained that the station receives trucks from the Ivory Coast and Nigeria with goods and as such taking over the place would affect such businesses.\n\r\nHe stated that because of what has occurred, all of the women are stranded, which will have an impact on them. The Chairman stated that those who arrived were armed, but they do not want any violence and preferred an amicable resolution to the issue.\n\r\nSome of the traders have petitioned President Akufo-Addo and Dr. Bawumia, whose names have been mentioned, to halt the project because the location is vital to their livelihood.

    "The extractive sector of Ghana has been a crucial contributor to the country's economy for several decades, particularly the mining sector, which has played a critical role in revenue mobilization, foreign exchange earnings, employment creation, and overall stimulation of the Ghanaian economy.\n\r\nDespite this, multinational gold mining companies operating in mineral-rich developing countries continue to benefit from their activities, while the nexus between company profits, socioeconomic, and environmental outcomes in the local communities within which they operate remains weak.\n\r\nCommunities lose lands, cultural sites, cultural identity, income-earning assets and sources, networks, and social ties due to resettlement, while also facing challenges such as environmental degradation and human rights abuses. The 1992 constitution and the Minerals and Mining Act, 2006, along with other regulations, have been enacted to address fair, adequate, and timely payment of compensation claims and resettlements. \n\r\nHowever, the current legal and regulatory regime has been criticized for failing to compensate for lands and the use of common resources in communities, leading to a need for further understanding of power dynamics, processes, actions, and community experiences regarding what the law states and what is practiced.\n\r\nA new report by Obuasi based research and advocacy group Cesis sheds light on the experiences of mining communities in Ghana with regard to compensation and resettlement. The Center for Social Impact Studies (CeSIS) with support from the Third World Network through the Power of Our Voices Project (PVP), aimed to investigate the challenges faced by mining communities and to influence policies for communities affected by resettlement. \n\r\nThe report, which was validated by the community and has been made available, reveals that compensation and resettlement are among the most common issues raised by mining communities in Ghana. The findings highlight the need for continued efforts to promote responsible mining practices and to ensure that the interests of affected communities are prioritized.\n\r\nThrowing more light on the report, Robert Ali Tanti the Executive Director of the Center for Social Impact Studies (CESIS) said through interactions with the communities, they discovered that compensation and resettlement are among the most common issues raised, with even those who had been previously compensated expressing dissatisfaction with the compensation received.\n\r\nTo address these issues, he said CeSIS undertook a research project with support from the Third World Network through the Power of Our Voices Project (PVP), aimed at investigating the experiences of mining communities with regard to resettlement and compensation. The research was conducted in the Ashanti and Ahafo Regions, with Obuasi being the focus area due to its status as the city with the most mining activities in the Ashanti Region.\n\r\nRobert Tanti further disclosed that three communities were selected for the research, including Anhwiem, a community seeking resettlement, Dokyiwaa, a recently resettled community, and Bediem, a community resettled in 1996, with the goal of influencing policies for communities affected by resettlement and helping those who have been affected by such policies.\n\r\nThe research also aimed to assist communities to build capacity to negotiate better with their findings. The team employed four strategies in data gathering, including conducting surveys and using the Slovin's formula to calculate the sample size. They also conducted key informant interviews with people involved in the resettlement process, particularly in the Dekyiwaa and Bediem communities, and held focused group discussions.\n\r\nThe Executive Director of CeSIS noted that the team had conducted their analysis, validated the report two weeks prior, and the report was now available. They had conducted community validation of their findings and engaged the media to spread awareness about their research and the laws governing resettlement. \n\r\nHe emphasized that people and communities who are resettled should have a better life than their previous location, but most people affected by resettlement are not satisfied with their new location and environment.\n\r\nA Resource person for the day Richard Elimah, expounded on the substantial economic benefits of mining in Ghana, highlighting its role as the highest contributor to domestic revenue in the country. He drew attention to the critical contribution of both large-scale and small-scale mining to the country's economy and the significant employment opportunities they provide. \n\r\nSpecifically, he pointed out that the mining industry employs over 12,000 people in the large-scale mining sector, while the number of people employed in small-scale mining exceeds 40,000 and could even reach as high as a million.\n\r\nBeyond the economic benefits, Mr. Elimah also addressed the legal framework and principles of compensation surrounding mining activities in Ghana. He provided attendees with a detailed explanation of the applicable laws, ensuring that they were familiar with the legal framework that regulates mining activities in the country. He emphasized the importance of fairness and equity in compensation for communities affected by mining activities.\n\r\nAgain, he highlighted some of the key principles that guide the compensation process, stressing the importance of a consultative approach that involves affected stakeholders throughout the process. Mr. Elimah underscored the significance of engaging with community members in the compensation process, ensuring that their concerns and interests are adequately represented.\n\r\nThe participants emphasized the importance of organizations like CeSIS in promoting responsible mining practices and ensuring that the voices of affected communities are heard. By providing a platform for stakeholders to engage and share their experiences, organizations like CeSIS play a critical role in promoting greater transparency, accountability, and equitable distribution of benefits in the mining sector.\n\r\nIn all, the participants positive response to CeSIS's presentation highlighted the need for continued efforts to promote responsible mining practices in Ghana and to ensure that the interests of affected communities are prioritized. \n\r\nThe insights provided by CeSIS's research and engagement efforts will be instrumental in shaping policy decisions and driving meaningful change for the betterment of mining communities in Ghana.",

    "Coalition of National Youth Organizers wish to congratulate K.T. Hammond on his appointment as the New Trade Minister.\n\r\nWe want to draw your attention to the fact that, Current trade ministry is a mess, with foreigners flooding the Ghanaian market and a disconnect between the Association of Ghanaian Industries and the Association of Ghanaian Traders.\n\r\nWe are therefore appealing to you, to encourage the Ghanaian business community to develop interest in electronic ocmmerce (E-commerce)\n\r\nWe are suggesting to government to sponsor a training workshop sensitize business owners on the importance of E-commerce models such as\n\nBusiness to Business (B2B)\n\r\nWhich allows one business establishment to trade with another trader online.\n\r\nThis practice will not only reduce the risk of carrying hard currency and its consequences but it will make it easier for government to trace payable taxes.\n\nBusiness to Consumer (B2C)\n\r\nWhich allows one business establishment transacts business with the Consumer online. \n\r\nThis model will not only allow government to trace payable taxes of both businesses and consumers but reduce the fraud that occurs during business transactions.\n\nBusiness to Government (B2G)\n\r\nWhich allows businesses to transact business with government will empower transparency in how government transacts business.\n\r\nThis will cure the procurement breaches and the corruption that has bedridden most state institutions.\n\r\nGovernment through this medium can check every transaction done for and its behalf to get the best deals.\n\r\nSince most of such transactions are not done with hard cash, it can stabilize the Cedi, since there will be less demand on hard currencies particularly the foreign currencies.\n\r\nWe are also suggesting to government to consider training more youth, particularly unemployed graduates, of which some includes former NABCO recruits in E-commerce and cyber security, so that they can be employed by these business establishment.\n\r\nThis is a win-win situation for both government, the business community and the unemployed youth of Ghana particularly unemployed graduates.",
    "Chiefs and elders of Tongu traditional areas in the Volta region's Tongu enclave have warned against anyone attempting to intimidate the MP for North Tongu, Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa.\n\r\nThe caution was sent ahead of the MP's first appearance in court on the case between him and the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the National Cathedral Project, Rev. Kusi Boateng.\n\r\nAt a press conference held on Sunday, February 19, 2023, in Battor, the chiefs, elders, and people of the area were clad in red attire, chanted songs of solidarity, and performed traditional prayers in favour of their MP.\n\r\nAccording to them, they do not see anything wrong with the MP because he's fighting against corruption and just doing his constitutional mandate, hence the need for him to be protected and not victimised.\n\r\nManklalo of Dorfor Traditional Area, Togbe Agbohla VI, said they shall not tolerate those behind this shameless plot of intimidation, abuse of judiciary, harassment, and evil concoctions as they seek to gag and harm our MP.\n\r\nHe served a notice that, \"Should our MP suffer the slightest harm, they would not only have touched the tail of a tiger but the forehead of Tongu Danyi wo\".\n\r\n\"It is absolutely unacceptable that persons who are perceived to be corrupt are shielded and protected in our country today just because they enjoy close proximity with very important people in the country, while those exposing their evil deeds in the national interest become victims and are constantly attacked with a ridiculous plot to have them imprisoned,\" the Manklalo bemoaned.\n\r\nThe Chiefs, on the other hand, urged the President, Nana Akufo Addo, to provide security for the MP because they trusted him with their future.\n\r\nThey also called on the diplomatic communities in the country, civil society organisations, the Volta Regional House of Chiefs, Councilof State, and the clergy to stand up and support the MP's course.\n\r\nThe Chiefs concluded that it is a constitutional mandate for every citizen to report wrongdoing, and if the reward for speaking out against obvious and blatant wrongdoing is prosecution in court and in sections of the rented media, then Ghana's fight against corruption and crime is in a rather sorry state, hence the need to free Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa and desist from prosecuting him.\n\r\nSome residents who were at the press conference said they would be at the court scheduled for Tuesday, February 21, 2023, in Accra to show their solidarity.",

If they had called the Fire Service early, we would have been here to contain the fire,” he said.\n\r\nD.O III Avevor cautioned that high voltage-consuming gadgets shouldn’t be fixed in extension boards, to prevent fire outbreaks.",
