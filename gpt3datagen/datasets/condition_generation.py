    "The 6.7-inch iPhone 15 Plus could have some minor design updates compared to the iPhone 14 Plus, according to renders that were shared today by 9to5Mac. The images are said to be based on CAD drawings of the devices that were provided to Apple's supply chain for device manufacturing, and they follow leaks that we've previously seen for both the standard iPhone 15 and the iPhone 15 Pro.\u200ciPhone 14\u200c Plus vs. \u200ciPhone 15\u200c Plus, image via 9to5MacThe images indicate that in addition to a \u200cDynamic Island\u200c, the \u200ciPhone 15\u200c Plus will have slightly slimmer bezels, and there may be minor tweaks to the size and thickness of the device. 9to5Mac says that the \u200ciPhone 15\u200c Plus CAD design features \"slightly rounded edges\" for a smoother transition from the front of the device to the back and a slightly thicker camera bump.Apple's \u200ciPhone 15\u200c Plus is expected to be identical in design and feature set to the \u200ciPhone 15\u200c, and it will continue to include a dual-lens camera with Wide and Ultra Wide lenses. The main difference between the \u200ciPhone 15\u200c and \u200ciPhone 15\u200c Plus is expected to be battery size, as the \u200ciPhone 15\u200c Plus is 6.7 inches and the \u200ciPhone 15\u200c is 6.1 inches.Other \u200ciPhone 15\u200c and \u200ciPhone 15\u200c Plus rumored features include the same A16 chip that's in the iPhone 14 Pro models, a Qualcomm X70 modem, and blue and pink color options.

    "Tales of Symphonia is one of the best entries in the long-running Tales JRPG series, and one of the more exceptional games in the Nintendo GameCube’s otherwise short-lived and uneven library. Naturally, old fans and newcomers alike were pumped to see the cult classic get a remaster for the Switch. What a shame, then, that the recent remaster is a subpar port at best, leading publisher Bandai Namco to apologize and promise an upcoming patch.“We have confirmed that there is a problem with gameplay in this product version that is currently on sale,” reads a rough translation of a tweet thread labeled “Apology and Information.” “We are currently investigating a fix.” Bandai Namco doesn’t go into detail about which problems it’s talking about or when the first update might arrive. Kotaku has reached out for comment.The acknowledgement comes a week after Tales of Symphonia Remastered came out on both Switch and PS4. The cute and colorful role-playing game tasks you with fulfilling an ancient prophecy and fighting back the evil overtaking a dying world—standard JRPG fare elevated by likable characters and a fun hybrid combat system.Fans were already in an uproar over the fact that the new version would be capped at 30FPS rather than run at 60FPS like the original GameCube version, but hands-on time confirmed other shortcomings as well, from long load times to some textures breaking under the new HD upscaling. A number of players have been sharing their frustrations online, even going so far as to compare footage directly against older HD versions available on PS3 and Steam:Pretty gamingThis keyboard has RGB LED backlit keys for style, an aluminum base for strength, and mechanical brown switches for a good feel and great reaction speed. I’ve spent a few hours with the Switch version over the past week and while I’m enjoying playing it overall, the technical shortcomings and lack of new quality-of-life features leave a bad taste, especially for a $40 port of a nearly 20-year-old game. The colors are bright and the resolution is sharp, but the longer load times between random encounters really do start to drag and the lack of any auto-save feature is a real head scratcher. As RPG Site points out in its review, even small things are missing like fades between scenes that now jarringly cut to black, or the blurred background when navigating the pause menu.We’ve seen this before with 2022’s remaster of Chrono Cross. While the game included new quality-of-life features like unlocking fast-forward right from the start and letting you scale down the difficulty, the HD effect was hit-or-miss and the framerate actually performed worse than in the original PS1 version. It wasn’t until just this week that the game finally got an update attempting to improve its performance, targeting a ceiling of 60 FPS.Hopefully, it doesn’t take as long for Tales of Symphonia Remastered to get patched, though I’m not optimistic it won’t still end up feeling like a major missed opportunity. If you’ve been waiting decades to get back to Lloyd and company’s fight against the Desians to bring peace and stability back to the land of Sylverant, I can say it hasn’t lost its charm. I just wish it had been transported through time with more care and fanfare. \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0",
    "Filed under:Larian explains why its D&D RPG is bound for one console onlyLarian Studios will officially release its Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game Baldur’s Gate 3 — which has been playable in early access since 2020 — on Aug. 31, on MacOS, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC. But a version of Baldur’s Gate 3 isn’t on the table yet for Xbox, the developer says, and it’s not for platform-exclusivity reasons.Baldur’s Gate 3’s summertime release was revealed Thursday during Sony’s State of Play showcase. A new trailer for the RPG introduced Baldur’s Gate fans to General Ketheric Thorm, a “seemingly invincible necromancer leading an army of the dead” who — bonus! — just happens to be voiced by the beloved and intimidating J.K. Simmons.That trailer also highlighted two new features for Baldur’s Gate 3: split-screen co-op play, enabling two players on one PlayStation 5 (or up to four with online co-op); and controller support. The former feature, Larian says, is partly why there’s no Xbox version of Baldur’s Gate 3... yet. After Larian creative director Swen Vincke took to Twitter to assure fans the studio wasn’t “playing the exclusivity game” with Xbox fans, the studio took to Reddit for an expanded explanation of what’s going on.So, don’t give up hope, Xbox fans. If Larian can get it working on Xbox Series X (and also Xbox Series S), you may be facing down necro J.K. Simmons by end of year.A weekly roundup of the best things from PolygonPlease check your email to find a confirmation email, and follow the steps to confirm your humanity.Oops. Something went wrong.

    "Filed under:Looking to make the most of your brand new headset?If the PlayStation VR 2 is your first foray into the world of VR and you’re looking for some guidance on what you should be playing first, you’ve come to the right place. After nearly a week with the PSVR 2, we’ve narrowed down some of the top games across a variety of genres to really put your new headset to work. Now that we’ve had a chance to play launch line-up games like Horizon Call of the Mountain, Resident Evil Village in VR, and more, we can confidently share titles you should be downloading first. Unquestionably the most graphically impressive game on PSVR 2 right now is Horizon Call of the Mountain. This spinoff based on the popular open-world series has you clambering up cliff sides and firing off arrows as you attempt to survive some encounters with nasty robotic critters. As the primary exclusive, Horizon is the main showcase of the PSVR 2’s many unique features, from eye tracking to in-helmet haptics to adaptive triggers.Just a note: If you’re brand-new to VR or you get motion sickness easily, Horizon is going to be a bit of a tough pill to swallow, since it’s built around some of the more quease-inducing gameplay aspects in VR. Until the game adds a teleport movement option, be very wary.While less of a graphical stunner than Horizon, The Last Clockwinder makes up for it by being one of the most unique and creative VR games ever made. The premise: You’re attempting to revive a defunct clock tower by using robots that record your exact movements. So, if you want to turn a crank, you can record the movement of you doing it once and the robot will then turn the crank forever. This gets increasingly complicated as you record yourself throwing balls into the air that another recorded robot can then catch and move along the line, until you have a fully automated assembly line. All of this is paired with an endearing storyline and stellar art design.One of Polygon’s favorite games of the last decade continues to get revived for new platforms, and PSVR 2 gets the latest incarnation. If you’re familiar with Tetris, you’ll be well served here, thanks to an incredible backing soundtrack and trippy visuals. The PSVR 2’s haptics groove along to the beat in cool ways, and as a bizarre extra feature, you can activate “Zone” mode just by closing your eyes, thanks to Tetris Effect’s use of eye tracking. Tetris Effect is also very welcoming to new VR players, with minimal risk of yarfing. Always a good thing!Another music-heavy re-release in the vein of Tetris Effect, Thumper arrives on PSVR 2 as the thumpiest title in the launch line-up. This action rhythm game has you piloting a metal bug as it zooms along a track, and you’ll have to hit the right inputs timed to the music to ensure that you don’t turn said metal bug into scrap. The trippy, Tron-esque visuals fill your entire field of vision thanks to PSVR 2’s wide, 110-degree viewing angle, and the helmet’s haptics will bounce right along with the beat… so long as you’re hitting your cues. A stellar experience for anyone who enjoys a laser light show every now and then.The cutest titles in PSVR 2’s launch line-up are Moss and Moss Book 2, games that have you commanding a little field mouse as it attempts to take on various fantasy beasts. This is a strange twist on the VR format, in that you’re overseeing all of the action from above rather than stepping into the perspective of Quill, Moss’s adorable mouse. New to PSVR 2 are improved haptics and the PS5’s adaptive triggers, which make the experience of mouse survival all the more harrowing.No Man’s Sky has supported VR since way back in 2019, arriving on the first PlayStation VR and PC. Since then, the game has seen a number of updates, but the VR functionality hasn’t gotten as much love. That changed with the Fractal update, timed with the launch of PlayStation VR 2.In addition to adding native support for PlayStation VR 2 on PS5, the Fractal update massively enhances the VR experience across all platforms. New context-sensitive gestures and buttons allow you to access your quick menus and multi-tool abilities much faster than before. You can also freely examine the cockpit of your favorite starships, which are now fully rendered and interactable in VR.Given the remarkable post-launch support that No Man’s Sky has gotten, it is easily one of the most robust and jaw-dropping VR experiences available on any platform, and it is a great showpiece for PlayStation VR 2.The original PlayStation VR launched with support for Resident Evil 7, thus making one of the scariest games ever made even more horrifying. Capcom is continuing that strategy by releasing a PlayStation VR 2-friendly mode for Resident Evil Village right alongside the headset’s launch day.This new mode allows you to experience the main campaign entirely in VR, with brand new mechanics for inventory management, weapon aiming, and knife slicing. The game looks absolutely stunning in VR, offering up some of the best visuals we’ve seen in PSVR 2. It’s also a blast to play, so long as you can stomach the lack of a teleport movement option. But if you can handle Horizon Call of the Mountain, this should be no problem at all.Please check your email to find a confirmation email, and follow the steps to confirm your humanity.Oops.

    "At this point, ChatGPT hardly needs an introduction. The chatbot took the world by storm late last year, and hasn’t let go since, impressing us all with its ability to answer questions and create things while frequently passing the Turing Test. While AI is changing rapidly, faster than many ever predicted, so too are ChatGPT’s features. One such feature is the ability to save your conversations for later, without needing to copy and paste them somewhere else.If you primarily use ChatGPT on your computer, you might have noticed this change already. On desktop, ChatGPT added a new sidebar, which sports all of the conversations you’ve had before (at least all of the conversations ChatGPT saved). However, you don’t need to use ChatGPT on your computer in order to access your previous chats. If you, like me, ask ChatGPT things using the web app on your smartphone, you’ll find this new sidebar by tapping the hamburger menu in the top-left corner of the screen.ChatGPT automatically titles each chat based on the first question you ask. It’s actually cool to see in action: The titles remains “New chat” while ChatGPT answers your question. Once it finished, it then renames the chat with an accurate title based on what it said. For example, I asked ChatGPT, “What math concepts are important to know when learning to code?” It gave me its answer, then renamed the chat “Math for Coding.”If you don’t like the name ChatGPT gave the chat, you can rename it yourself. Select the chat in question, then tap the pencil icon to give it a new name, then click the checkmark to save it.Shop sales in every category.Uh-oh, overstock: Wayfair put their surplus on sale for up to 50% off.While there’s no reason to think ChatGPT would stop saving these chats in the future, they’re still not backed up this way, at least not in a traditional sense. If you have a particularly interesting encounter with the chatbot, and you want to preserve that interaction for posterity (or to share with your friends), it might still be a good idea to copy and paste it to a note on your phone or computer.While many might find this automatic cataloging of previous chats useful, others might not. After all, ChatGPT started out quite ephemeral: You’d have a conversation, then leave it behind, ready to start something new next time.It’s easy to delete conversations, if you want: Choose the conversation in question, select the trash can icon, then choose the checkmark to delete it. You can also clear your entire conversation history from the “Clear conversations” options towards the bottom of the sidebar. [How-To Geek]",

    'Google scientists said Wednesday they have passed a major milestone in their quest to develop effective quantum computing, with a new study showing they reduced the rate of errors – long an obstacle for the much-hyped technology.Quantum computing has been touted as a revolutionary advance that uses our growing scientific understanding of the subatomic world to create a machine with powers far beyond those of today\'s conventional computers.However, the technology remains largely theoretical, with many thorny problems still standing in the way – including stubbornly high error rates.In new research published in the journal Nature, the Google Quantum AI lab described a system that can significantly decrease the error rate.That could give the US tech giant a step up on its rivals, such as IBM, which is also working on superconducting quantum processors.While traditional computers process information in bits that can be represented by 0 or 1, quantum computers use qubits, which can be a combination of both at the same time.This property, known as superposition, means that a quantum computer can crunch an enormous number of potential outcomes simultaneously.The computers harness some of the most mind-boggling aspects of quantum mechanics, including a phenomenon known as " entanglement" – in which two members of a pair of bits can exist in a single state, even if far apart.But a problem called decoherence can cause the qubits to lose their information when they leave their quantum state and come into contact with the outside world.This fragility causes high error rates, which also increase with the number of qubits, frustrating scientists wanting to ramp up their experiments.However, Google\'s team said it had demonstrated for the first time in practice that a system using error-correcting code can detect and fix errors without affecting the information.The system was first theorized in the 1990s, however, previous attempts had just thrown up more errors, not less, said Google\'s Hartmut Neven, a co-author of the study."But if all components of your system have sufficiently low error rates, then the magic of quantum error correction kicks in," Neven told a press conference.Julian Kelly, another study co-author, hailed the development as "a key scientific milestone", saying that "quantum error correction is the single most important technology for the future of quantum computing".Neven said the result was still "not good enough, we need to get to an absolute low error rate".He added that "there are more steps to come" to achieve the dream of a usable quantum computer.Google claimed in 2019 it had passed a milestone known as "quantum supremacy", when the tech giant said its Sycamore machine executed a calculation in 200 seconds that would have taken a conventional supercomputer 10,000 years to complete.However, the achievement has since been disputed, with Chinese researchers saying last year that a supercomputer could have beaten Sycamore\'s time.© Agence France-Presse',
    'Front page layoutSite themeThe launch of the iPhone 14 made satellite messaging the hot new feature in smartphones. You\'ve been able to get big, bulky, ugly satellite phones for years with full satellite calling and messaging, but it turns out if you scope down the feature to only "emergency SOS," and heavily compress everything, you can connect to a satellite from a normal smartphone form factor. Since the iPhone announcement, everyone in Android land has been eager to copy this, and we\'ve seen satellite connectivity announcements from Qualcomm, Samsung, MediaTek, and Huawei and news that some kind of satellite support will be built into Android 14. Mostly these are chip and software announcements—not many companies have been talking about satellite products end users will actually be able to buy—until now.Bullitt—a British phone manufacturer best known for licensing the heavy machinery "Caterpillar" brand for ruggedized smartphones—is launching what sounds like a full end-to-end solution that will bring satellite messaging to non-iPhone users. It\'s launching the "Bullitt Satellite Connect" service, an app to connect to it called the "Bullitt Satellite Messenger," and a "Cat S75" smartphone with satellite connectivity. It\'s teaming up with Motorola to introduce a second satellite messaging phone, the "Motorola Defy 2," and a satellite messaging hotspot called the "Motorola Defy Satellite Link." There\'s a lot to go over.First up is the service. Unlike the iPhone, which can only contact emergency services over satellite one way, Bullitt Satellite Connect claims to be a two-way messaging service and "the most advanced mobile satellite messaging platform in the world." Satellite service starts at $4.99 per month, with "other flexible and heavier usage plans" available if you want to be a serious satellite texter. "SOS Assist," which offers "24/7 access to emergency response centers provided by FocusPoint International" is included in the price of every plan and free for the first year even if you just buy the hardware.It does not sound like texting over Bullitt Satellite Connect will be entirely seamless. You\'ll need to use the special Bullitt Satellite Messenger app to send a message over satellite, and the message is not SMS. Like some other proprietary messaging services, Bullitt will forward your message over SMS to your recipient\'s phone number, so they\'ll receive it, but to respond, the person you text will need to download the Bullitt Satellite Messenger app. The company notes: "The time to initially connect to the satellite and send a message is around 10 seconds."One question to ask of any satellite service is where its service is coming from, because there aren\'t that many satellites out there. Bullitt certainly doesn\'t have any satellites for its "Satellite Connect" service. The company says it\'s teaming up with another company called Skylo to get the service up and running, but Skylo is just running the network and doesn\'t have any satellites either. The press release says Skylo "manages connections to devices over existing licensed GEO satellite constellations, such as Inmarsat and others." There we go—Inmarsat is\xa0a real satellite company that has been around since the 1970s. Inmarsat currently has 14 satellites in geostationary orbit—that means they\'re way higher than the new wave of low-earth-orbit satellites—22,300 miles up. Inmarsat\'s most recent launch was last week with Space X, and the company currently provides Internet access to planes and boats.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.',
    "Front page layoutSite themeLast week, I visited a friend and, for the first time, saw a mechanical keyboard on her desk. This is someone I've known for decades and who's not into tech, so this was a surprise. But her job became partially remote since the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, so she needed something comfortable with a numpad to use at home. The keyboard was a cheap, quick buy off Amazon that earned its keep by looking cute and being\xa0\"so clicky,\" she informed me.My friend isn't alone in her newfound use of mechanical switches. Demand for more tactile and durable typing, gaming, and number crunching has led to prebuilt mechanical keyboards being incredibly easy to find. And while they can still be extremely costly, newcomers like my friend are able to find sub-$100 options that enthusiasts may scoff at but still represent an upgrade over a membrane or laptop keyboard.This widespread acceptance of mechanical keyboards has led to an even deeper corner of the hobby getting more attention of late: DIY customization.On Thursday, peripheral maker Glorious announced that its products had hit Best Buy, one of the hearts of global electronics retail. In addition to prebuilt keyboards, Glorious' Best Buy layout includes accessories for people interested in building or tweaking their mechanical keyboard, including barebones kits, top plates, a rotary knob, detachable cables, keycaps, mechanical switches, and even a lube kit.Best Buy has sold prebuilt mechanical keyboards for a while, but this addition gives its inventory a DIY boost that wasn't present before (save for a few cables and keycaps) and differs from other big-name retailers.\xa0Walmart, for example, doesn't sell keyboard kits, cable, or lube or mechanical switches directly online (you can get them off Walmart's site from third-party sellers, though); although, the company does sell one set of keycaps.This isn't about lauding Best Buy. In fact, its inventory is clearly built around its retail partnerships rather than offering the best, or even a diverse, selection to keyboard enthusiasts. But the addition of keyboard customization products like these is a sign of the growth of mechanical keyboards.And for those new to the hobby and those already elbow-deep in switches, stabilizers, and Krytox lube, this is a good thing.Best Buy's Glorious partnership is just one of a few recent signs of keyboard customization moving beyond tight hobbyist circles. More mainstream companies selling prebuilt mechanical keyboards, such as Logitech or Razer, typically don't expect you to alter their hardware. Most of their keyboards have soldered-down switches that would be very hard to change, and the vendors don't encourage you to remove their keycaps, unless they sell keycaps themselves. If you decided you want some new colors on your keyboard, they'd be happy to sell you an entirely new board.In 2021, I saw a notable sign of keyboard customization getting broader attention when HyperX, a more familiar name for PC gamers that's now owned by HP, announced a homegrown keyboard that came with two spacebar keycaps: one that was plain black like the rest, and one with a swirly, etched-in design. Not only was HyperX encouraging consumers to think about changing the look of their keyboard, it was including the basic tools (a keycap puller and extra keycap) needed to get the tinkering going for free.HyperX likely got the idea for this from Ducky, a more niche but beloved brand among mechanical keyboard fans. The HyperX Alloy Origins 60 came out the year after the HyperX x Ducky One 2 Mini, which also included a detailed spacebar keycap.Asus is also encouraging keyboard users to get more finicky about their keyboard.\xa0In January, it announced the ROG Azoth wireless mechanical keyboard that comes with a switch lube kit with a switch opener and puller, keycap puller, lube station and brush, and bottle of Krytox GPL-205-GD0.The ROG Azoth product page says it wants to \"get beginners started on keyboard DIY.\" The keyboard has the potential to get people who never considered the smoothness or sound of their switches to start doing so. It also gives owners who have considered lubing mechanical switches but weren't ready to buy the tools free incentive to give it a go.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.",
    "Filed under:Plans to skip a year are apparently abortedInstead of skipping a year, Activision’s Call of Duty franchise will get a full-price, stand-alone video game this fall, Bloomberg reports — but it’ll be a continuation of last year’s rebooted Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier noted in Thursday’s report that Activision’s plans for the series originally called for a “premium expansion” to Modern Warfare 2, rather than a full new game, sometime in 2023. This all goes back to 2020, when development difficulties moved Treyarch’s turn in Call of Duty’s three-studio rotation up a year, and brought us Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War a year ahead of schedule. Activision-owned Treyarch, Infinity Ward, and Sledgehammer Games had split production on the series, on a three-year development cycle, going back to 2014’s Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.Because of that workload hiccup, Activision at first planned to go through 2023 without a mainline Call of Duty entry, pushing Treyarch’s next regularly scheduled Call of Duty game to 2024. The paid expansion envisioned for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is instead a “premium Call of Duty game” now, according to an Activision spokesperson, with a single-player campaign and new multiplayer maps, Bloomberg says.The Call of Duty franchise will observe its 20th anniversary in 2023. Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Sledgehammer, and Activision Blizzard on the whole are in enveloped in a $68.7 billion attempted acquisition by Microsoft, announced last year, that regulators in the United Kingdom, United States, and European Union are holding up over antitrust concerns.A weekly roundup of the best things from PolygonPlease check your email to find a confirmation email, and follow the steps to confirm your humanity.Oops.

    'Front page layoutSite themeOn Friday, Meta announced a new AI-powered large language model (LLM) called LLaMA-13B that it claims can outperform OpenAI\'s GPT-3 model despite being "10x smaller." Smaller-sized AI models could lead to running ChatGPT-style language assistants locally on devices such as PCs and smartphones. It\'s part of a new family of language models called "Large Language Model Meta AI," or LLAMA for short.The LLaMA collection of language models range from 7 billion to 65 billion parameters in size. By comparison, OpenAI\'s GPT-3 model—the foundational model behind ChatGPT—has 175 billion parameters.Meta trained its LLaMA models using publicly available datasets, such as Common Crawl, Wikipedia, and C4, which means the firm can potentially release the model and the weights open source. That\'s a dramatic new development in an industry where, up until now, the Big Tech players in the AI race have kept their most powerful AI technology to themselves."Unlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only use datasets publicly available, making our work compatible with open-sourcing and reproducible, while most existing models rely on data which is either not publicly available or undocumented," tweeted project member Guillaume Lample.Meta calls its LLaMA models "foundational models," which means the firm intends the models to form the basis of future, more-refined AI models built off the technology, similar to how OpenAI built ChatGPT from a foundation of GPT-3. The company hopes that LLaMA will be useful in natural language research and potentially power applications such as "question answering, natural language understanding or reading comprehension, understanding capabilities and limitations of current language models."While the top-of-the-line LLaMA model (LLaMA-65B, with 65 billion parameters) goes toe-to-toe with similar offerings from competing AI labs DeepMind, Google, and OpenAI, arguably the most interesting development comes from the LLaMA-13B model, which, as previously mentioned, can reportedly outperform GPT-3 while running on a single GPU. Unlike the data center requirements for GPT-3 derivatives, LLaMA-13B opens the door for ChatGPT-like performance on consumer-level hardware in the near future.Parameter size is a big deal in AI. A parameter is a variable that a machine-learning model uses to make predictions or classifications based on input data. The number of parameters in a language model is a key factor in its performance, with larger models generally capable of handling more complex tasks and producing more coherent output. More parameters take up more space, however, and require more computing resources to run. So if a model can achieve the same results as another model with fewer parameters, it represents a significant gain in efficiency."I\'m now thinking that we will be running language models with a sizable portion of the capabilities of ChatGPT on our own (top of the range) mobile phones and laptops within a year or two," wrote independent AI researcher Simon Willison in a Mastodon thread analyzing the impact of Meta\'s new AI models.Currently, a stripped-down version of LLaMA is available on GitHub. To receive the full code and weights (the "learned" training data in a neural network), Meta provides a form where interested researchers can request access. Meta has not announced plans for a wider release of the model and weights at this time.Join the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.',
    "Nintendo’s new Metroid Prime Remastered—physical copies of the Switch game released on February 22, if you could get your hands on one—has a lot of stuff in it. While you guide unshakeable bounty hunter Samus Aran around the winding planet Tallon IV, you’ll pick some of it up, valuable upgrades and alterations to her powerful space suit. The Boost Ball will help you curl Samus into a speedy, silver sphere, for example, the flamethrower melts through opponents and dense slabs of ice, the x-ray visor lets you see every bone in an enemy’s body, and so on. The Gravity Suit, which grants Samus uninhibited exploration of underwater areas, is one of the most significant and important members of this stuff, but it can be a little tricky to find on your own. That’s where I come in. Here’s everything you need to know about getting the Gravity Suit.Not really, unfortunately. Getting the Gravity Suit requires the Ice Beam, which requires the Spider Ball upgrade, which requires you to beat boulder boss Thardus, which reminds me…Before you attempt to find the Gravity Suit, you need to make sure you’ve cleared most of the snow-coated Phendrana Drifts, including its Sheegoth mini-boss and true boss Thardus. Proceed once you’ve acquired the…Pretty gamingThis keyboard has RGB LED backlit keys for style, an aluminum base for strength, and mechanical brown switches for a good feel and great reaction speed. …the Gravity Suit is the next chronological upgrade.At this stage in the game, you’re likely accustomed to running to and from the Drifts for upgrades, but you might still feel unsure about the right pathway for you. It’s not your fault, Google Maps never made it to Tallon IV.So, OK, you got the Ice Beam from the stony Chozo Ruins antechamber and saved your game at the nearest station. Excellent. Now get your ass up and start another journey back to Phendrana Drifts.From the antechamber, head left through the doors until you’re able to scan and enter the Tallon Overworld South elevator. Or, instead of this, if you’d like, there’s an energy tank and artifact you can pick up—go back to the Hall of Elders to solve a Morph Ball puzzle for the tank, then go to the Suntower, scan four runic symbols, then receive the Artifact of Wild from the Sunchamber.Whether you’re now navigating from the Tallon Overworld or taking the Magmoor Caverns North elevator near the Sunchamber, your next goal is to make it to the Caverns’ Monitor Station. When you’re there, cross the bridge to reach the Phendrana Drifts North elevator; use it, reach the Phendrana Shorelines, and save your game.Read More: 13 Things I Wish I Knew Before Starting Metroid Prime RemasteredYou have options from here. You can move through Ice Ruins West until you make it all the way back to the Research Core to grab a missile expansion along the way, in Research Lab Hydra. Use your fresh Ice Beam to open the frosty door in this room, then go through the Pike Access hallway to reach Frozen Pike. Or, instead, you can return to Thardus’ boss room, Quarantine Cave, ignore the Magmoor elevator near it, and complete a Spider Ball maze to get to Frozen Pike.Either way, once you’re in Frozen Pike, you need to open the purple door with your Wave Beam. It leads to Frost Cave Access, which leads to Frost Cave, another save point. Save there, then curve left to the Upper Edge Tunnel and Phendrana’s Edge.You’re so close now! Get into the water and pass through doors until you’re in the Gravity Chamber—the Gravity Suit, marked by the S-shaped Metroid symbol, is spinning like a coin on the far side of the Chamber, on the left. Your Thermal Visor should help you identify it, making it appear yellow in the muck.The Gravity Suit lets you move and see more effortlessly underwater, and with it equipped, you’ll be able to reach the Wave Beam door that leads back to Hunter Cave, Frozen Pike and, ultimately, the Magmoor Caverns South elevator. Push your way back to the Landing Site in the Tallon Overworld. Go to the Frigate Crash Site and start swimming—there’s an underwater area you can now easily explore. I know this is basically where you started from, but you have to spend money to make money.\xa0",

While this is in no way new, there are some simple steps to mitigate the risk.\r  The \"hack\" involves the thief watching the victim type in their passcode, then steal the iPhone to access their data. In one case, a victim was locked out of her Apple account and lost about $10,000 from her bank account, according to The Wall Street Journal.\rBecause the login passcode offers access to most other apps —  and system settings —  a thief can use it to change the Apple ID password to lock victims out. \"Once you get into the phone, it's like a treasure box,\" said Alex Argiro, who investigated a high-profile theft ring as a New York Police Department detective before retiring last fall.\rThe thief can also use the device passcode to access iCloud Keychain, which puts a person's entire online life at risk. Argiro said these opportunistic crimes have increased in the past two years in New York. \"This is growing,\" he said. \"It is such an opportunistic crime. Everyone has financial apps.\"\rAll victims The Wall Street Journal interviewed had their iPhones stolen while socializing in public in places like bars. In some cases, victims were physically assaulted and intimidated into handing over their phones and passcodes, and others believed they were drugged.\rSgt. Robert Illetschko, the lead investigator in one case, said groups of two or three thieves would go to a bar and befriend the victims to try and access their iPhones. If they couldn't watch the victim type in their passcode, the thieves might try to get them to open a social media app or have the victim hand over their phone for a picture.\rSimilar cases have been reported in Austin, Denver, Boston, and London.\rIn another case, a man had his identity stolen because he had saved photos of his passport, driver's license, paycheck direct-deposit form and health insurance paperwork in the Photos app. He was able to regain access to his Apple ID, but it's highly likely the thief kept the sensitive information.\r Source: Elizaveta Galkina/The Wall Street Journal Face ID or Touch ID can help prevent such attacks since people won't need to type in a passcode. But in New York, authorities have suggested Face ID as a possible entry point into iPhones.\rSimilar to a passcode, a thief could grab an iPhone after a victim logs in using biometrics, then prevent the iPhone from going into sleep mode. However, that access would be more limited since a passcode is needed to enter Face ID or Touch ID settings.\rApple users can turn on a feature called Attention Detection for Face ID in Settings > Face ID & Passcode. It requires a person to look at the iPhone before it authenticates the log in, meaning thieves who drug their victims can't log into the iPhone with this method.\rAs The Wall Street Journal noted, iOS doesn't require a person to enter an older password before setting a new one for Apple ID. Hardware security keys supported by iOS 16.3 didn't prevent account changes using only the passcode. \rThe passcode could even be used to remove security keys from the account.\rAn Apple spokeswoman did say that account recovery policies are in place to protect users from bad actors accessing their accounts. \r\"We sympathize with users who have had this experience and we take all attacks on our users very seriously, no matter how rare,\" she said, adding that Apple believes these crimes are uncommon because they require the theft of the device and the passcode. \"We will continue to advance the protections to help keep user accounts secure.\"\rApple generally doesn't allow users to regain access to a stolen account, if a thief sets a recovery key on the Apple ID that the victim can't access.\rHow to protect yourself It's not certain why the Wall Street Journal is treated this like a new emergency, or an emergent vector of attack. Passcode theft has always been at some level a concern for users, and it has always been good advice to secure that code.\rIn some of the cases, thieves were able to steal a victim's Social Security Number because of tax forms saved in iCloud Photos. Some Apple apps let users search for text, and searching for \"SSN\" or \"TIN\" (taxpayer identification number) in Apple Photos produced the document photo.\rAlthough iCloud encryption can help prevent online hacking, it can't stop thieves from accessing sensitive information once they have iPhone access. So, storing such information in Apple Notes, Photos, or other apps is dangerous.\rNext, Apple users should set their own Apple ID recovery key, which prevents anyone else from doing it.\r\nOn an iPhone or Mac, go to Settings > Your Name > Password & Security.\nTap Recovery Key, then slide to enable it.

    "The biggest lie humanity has ever been told is that one size fits all. Every single one of us is different and unique, especially when it comes to the shape and size of our bodies. Bauer, a company that specializes in hockey gear, is finally taking that into account with a new partnership that will allow it  produce helmets that are custom fit for every user’s head.Enjoyment of a sport can often come down to whether or not a participant feels comfortable in the equipment they have to wear, and for a sport like hockey, there’s a lot of specialized gear needed to safely slide across a sheet of ice. Laces and straps on skates allow them to be easily adjusted to feel comfortable while still providing a secure fit, but hockey helmets are a different story. Users need to find a helmet that comes as close to fitting their head size and shape as possible, but hockey helmet selection can often be limited, and there’s not much in terms of adjustments offered for the foam liners that actually cushion the wearer’s head. You can tighten the chin strap so it doesn’t fall off, but that doesn’t make an ill-fitting helmet feel any more comfortable.As an extension of the company’s MyBauer program, which allows hockey players to customize the look and feel of equipment like sticks and goalie pads, Bauer has teamed up with EOS, which you might remember as the company that made Wilson’s dream of an airless basketball a reality through the use of advanced 3D printing techniques.The goal here wasn’t to create a hockey helmet that never goes flat, but one with cushioning inserts sized and shaped to perfectly contour to a specific user’s head. Before 3D printing, that wasn’t an impossible task, but the effort needed to create custom-shaped foam meant a perfectly fitted helmet would have been a very pricey bespoke creation. But now, Bauer can offer it to almost anyone willing to sit for a few minutes so a laser scanner can generate a 3D digital model of their head.Keep it light and stay secure.This combination wall light and security camera from eufy offers nightvision, 2K picture, and over 3 weeks of local video storage with no hidden fee. Get it for $50 off on Amazon with code: WSWLCE50US.That model is used to create the custom insert using Selective Laser Sintering, where a 3D printer uses a powerful laser to burn a powdered polymer into a solid structure, layer by layer. Like Wilson’s airless basketball, the custom helmet insert ends up having a complex lattice structure that makes it as pliable as foam, but also lighter, and far more breathable. It’s superior to foam in many ways, although not as cheap (for now). Bauer’s custom 3D printed helmet costs $478, which is a few hundred dollars more than its regular adjustable helmets. So while it might not be a solution for everyone, those who’ve struggled to find a hockey helmet with a perfect fit will be glad to know that one can be manufactured specifically for them.",
    'In context: Denuvo is an anti-tamper technology and DRM solution often adopted by large game publishers (and sometimes by indie studios) to protect their latest titles against piracy. There\'s someone, however, who has apparently made cracking this powerful DRM their life\'s mission. Game cracker "Empress" has once again achieved the impossible. After a brief beta period managed through her Telegram channel, the notorious hacker has released a "cracked" version of Hogwarts Legacy. The new action RPG set in Harry Potter\'s wizarding world was released just a couple of weeks ago, and it likely won\'t suffer much as publisher Warner Bros. has already sold more than 12 million copies (on PC, PS5 and Xbox).Empress\' ability to crack Denuvo on the latest DRM-protected games is a remarkable achievement. The cracker explains that Hogwarts Legacy is protected by "Denuvo v17" plus Steam\'s own (mild) DRM. The "NFO" file accompanying the cracked release (no download link is provided, of course) is extremely opinionated as per tradition, as Empress is seemingly fully supporting authoress J. K. Rowling as a "real woman" against what she describes as the "woke system."Despite questionable opinions and foul language, Empress\' technical skills are among the best in the "scene."Also see: Hogwarts Legacy GPU Benchmark: 53 GPUs TestedAs a Reddit user put it, being able to crack Denuvo today is essentially "insane." Empress is just a single developer against an entire team of professionals, she has (or should have) no access to Denuvo source code, and yet can seemingly defeat the DRM and anti-tampering technology in just a couple weeks.Before being banned from Reddit, Empress had expressed some frustration against the complexity she found in the latest Denuvo versions. For this reason, the anti-DRM cracker decided to change her habits by reserving a considerable amount of her time to defeating the much maligned Denuvo tech on the latest games coming on PC.Denuvo is also often accused of affecting game performance negatively (and known for receiving bad press for various reasons). One YouTuber had compared the Steam version of the game and the Empress release on a low-end gaming system (Core i7-7700, GeForce GTX 1060 6GB, 16GB of RAM), and found the cracked release to provide higher frame rates, however this was later corrected as the comparison was invalid. The "slower" Steam version was running with the Steam overlay turned on, which was impacting performance. In a later re-test it\'s shown that DRM does not seem to affect performance.Hogwarts Legacy has been widely praised for the amazing gameplay, but gamers on the PC platform have complained about stuttering since day one, even on high-end systems. A patch released on February 14 was meant to alleviate some of this, with the notes specifically mentioning "shader type compilation optimization," but this hasn\'t worked for everyone. To learn more about shader compilation and why it causes stuttering, read our explainer here.Update (Feb 25): The original story wrongfully reported that Denuvo DRM had a negative impact on Hogwarts Legacy\'s performance. There is, after all, no free performance gain when the DRM is removed from the game.TECHSPOT : Tech Enthusiasts, Power Users, GamersTechSpot is a registered trademark.

    "The woman with three arms and three legs won’t get out of my mountainside camp. She doesn’t appear to be a threat, and she must be freezing in her undies, but then again it must be a nightmare finding clothes that fit. It’s just…really unsettling. I know there are cannibals on this island, but she doesn’t seem to be one of them—rather just a lost triped who seems troublingly obsessed with running around the outside of my log cabin.Sons of the Forest (SotF) is a sequel to 2018’s The Forest, an enormously successful survival game released at the peak of the genre. In The Forest, your plane crashed over a remote wilderness, in which you tried to survive by building shelter and fire, catching wild animals, and foraging through the scattered luggage from the crash for scraps and essentials…right up until the astonishingly creepy mutant creatures started sniffing around your camp. In SotF, your helicopter crashes over a remote island, on which you tried to survive by building shelter and fire, catching wild animals, and foraging through the scattered…you get the idea. It is, in its initial Early Access Steam launch, a very similar game.That’s no bad thing, given The Forest provided a really fascinating combination of survival and horror. It was remarkable how well it combined the enormously popular genre of wilderness survival with a first-person fright-fest. Its genius was its subtlety, the way it played everything so straight until that first time you saw a peculiar figure scampering away through the trees, then maybe stumbled upon a hideous totem built from body parts and tennis rackets. The Forest was a game in which you could spend hour after hour building yourself a wonderfully elaborate wooden village, and then suddenly find yourself taken captive and held in an underground chamber lined with pulsating mutant horror.Sons of the Forest begins incredibly similarly, but this time for some reason you’re joined by a second survivor, a young man who appears to have had some sort of lobotomy (both ears are bleeding) to whom you can give written instructions on a pad of paper. “BUILD A FIRE,” or “COLLECT WOOD AND DROP IT HERE.” He gleefully gets on with his tasks, taking the busywork burden off of you as you begin putting together your lovely log cabin.Pretty gamingThis keyboard has RGB LED backlit keys for style, an aluminum base for strength, and mechanical brown switches for a good feel and great reaction speed. As before, you do this by chopping down trees (a superbly detailed process; you’re even able to direct which way it’ll fall by chipping out a chunk, then hacking away at the thing from the opposite side), gathering sticks and stones, and then plopping them magically into ghostly frames. Realism is not a primary factor in Sons. And as before, while you’re getting yourself set up with somewhere to sleep and eat, the local peculiar humanoid creatures will begin nervously sniffing around your camp.Everything is vastly more pretty in the new game, and the scope of the island wonderfully ambitious. I’ve started two different games, one beginning in the summer, one in the spring, and each time the helicopter crashed in a different location. The first, in the rainy summer, was very similar to the first game (which made for an unfortunate first impression), albeit amongst wonderfully rendered trees, with photorealistic deer bounding around, and gorgeous bunnies snuffling in the foliage. The second time I landed on the side of a snow-covered mountain, with views like I’ve never seen a game able to generate, and extraordinary snow detail as my feet crunched rough paths through the white blanket. However, the temperature didn’t appear to have any effect on the game at all, which felt a little odd.From both starting points, after setting up camp, I was quick to explore, and it’s here that I suspect Sons of the Forest will continue to distinguish itself: There’s just a lot more going on. In one incarnation, I quickly found a cave containing human remains and a lot of useful crafting supplies, then when emerging discovered I was surrounded by creepy humanish creatures scampering about on all fours. They were awfully cross with me, and things turned ugly fast, as I swung wildly with my axe, taking down four before a fifth walloped me from behind. I woke up to find myself tied by my legs and waist to a pole in the middle of their crude camp. After escaping, I scrambled to another cave entrance marked on the game’s fancy new GPS, which then switched from rocky cave walls to human-built drywall. Cave-ins blocked some directions, but I found a storage room with some excellent gear on the shelves, and a 3D printer that allowed me to create a bunch of arrows, some grapples, and, er…a creepy mask.Around the snowy mountain I discovered far larger caves, only possible to further explore if I could find a way to cross a rope stretching over an unclimbable wall of stone. I then climbed further up the mountain and found a large frozen pond, with abandoned sleds in the middle. With awful cracking noises under my feet, I made my way to the middle, and grabbed all I could before dashing back to the side. Here was a blue-glowing cave, with icicles almost concealing the entrance. And then the three-legged lady showed up.It’s worth noting that your odyssey begins with your helicopter not crashing for unknown reasons, but rather because it’s shot by bullets. This implies that there’s an awful lot more happening on this island than just mutant cannibals, not least that when you briefly come around after your accident, a man in a silver suit glares, then knocks you out with the butt of his gun. Hmmmm. You’re there this time because a billionaire family—mother, father and daughter—have gone missing, and you’ve been tasked with finding them. There’s clearly a far larger narrative to explore this time out. But rather crucially, it remains entirely optional.That was a major joy of the first game, and is being repeated in this sequel: You can approach it as you see fit, playing it as a dead-straight survival sim, going in hell-for-leather trying to fight with everything, or focusing on exploration, trying to piece together its story. However, in a brilliant move, this time out you can much more heavily define this experience in the options.It’s now possible to change the behavior of the mutants in a range of ways, individually raising or lowering their health, damage, armor, and most importantly, aggression. Turn all these down and they’ll mostly leave you alone, so long as you leave them alone. Turn them up in various combinations, and it’s going to be scary out there. You can also tweak the numbers of animals, the season you start in, and how long days and seasons last. You can even make it rain less. These are wonderful options that really understand how differently people want to play a game like this, and ensure it’s as interesting as it can be to as wide an audience as possibleThe original The Forest was one of the true success stories of the Early Access model, originally debuting in 2014, and growing progressively more interesting to play over the next four years as it evolved through the feedback of its players. There’s every hope this follow-up can do the same.Some immediate improvements are definitely needed, like ways to assign hotkeys for equipping chosen items, such as the knife and axe, without having to faff with the backpack. It also needs much better on-screen prompts for how to build things like fires. (Weirdly, an entire log cabin is simply built using the daft ghost-frame, but a simple fire is now much more complex and hands-on, requiring that you break sticks in half and pile them up; the method for doing this is unexplained and damned weird.)I’d also say that while the crafting gives you lots to aim for, it lacks a narrative reason to bother. The idea that you’re looking for these billionaires is sort of implied in the (madly, unskippable) opening cutscene, but then never mentioned again by anything in-game. It really needs to establish the narrative a bit more, to offer the player a bunch more carrots from the start, and then leave it up to them if they want to follow.But SotF is already leagues ahead of where The Forest began, and has co-op in place already. (No word on if The Forest’s much-lauded, terrifying VR support will be returning, though.) The GPS is a huge improvement, giving you locations of interest to aim toward from the very start, and thus an incentive to explore outward from wherever you happened to crash, even if it’s not really explained why.And yes, wow, I’ve mentioned how gorgeous it is, but it cannot be emphasized enough. This is a legitimately stunning game, one in which I kept finding myself just stopping and looking, distracted by enjoying a view, or how the sunlight breaks through between tree branches over my snow-covered cabin. A lot of work is needed on the human faces and NPC animations, which really break the magic, but there’s likely years of Early Access ahead to see that all happen.Oftentimes you might be put off by the “Early Access” label, wanting rather to wait until it’s just finished and officially out. But Sons of the Forest is already a very complete experience. I started playing The Forest in 2014, and then returned to it regularly over its years of development, and found it the most incredibly satisfying experience. From my first few hours with this sequel, I’d say something very similar is likely to happen.Sons of the Forest’s similarities seem both a boon and a curse. I’d love to have seen this ambitious sequel distinguishing itself a bit more from the original, evincing a more distinct and original idea, rather than be a 10-years-later update of the formula. However, it’s an incredibly good formula, and this is an incredibly good rendition of it. I cannot wait to see what’s to come.",

    "Overwatch 2 doesn’t have a Mei homing grenade, but it could, and the promise of a weapon that would single-handedly seek out the ice-loving pain in my ass is enough to have players daydreaming about the possibilities.Read More: Everything That’s Happened in the Microsoft- Activision Merger SagaThe official Overwatch Twitter account shared a video of a dev build where, as suggested by a player, Cassidy’s Magnetic Grenade “[finds] Mei anywhere on the map and immediately [eliminates] her.” In the clip, which takes place on the Shambali Monastery map, Cassidy hucks his grenade a few feet in front of him just for it to careen down an alley, bypassing several other characters to stick to a Mei standing at the very end of it. She then, predictably, dies.Though the tweet also makes it very clear that the team “won’t be implementing this suggestion,” players can’t help themselves. Dozens of quote tweets are begging for this “buff” to be added to the game immediately, with Overwatch commercial lead\xa0Jon Spector replying with “don’t let your memes be dreams!” OWL player and streamer Jack Wright wrote “push it live, you won’t” while Overwatch news account Overwatch Cavalry brought up the iconic 2018 meme where a sign from an OWL event that read “Let Zen walk” resulted in the dev team animating a horrifying walk for the hovering omnic monk. Pretty gamingThis keyboard has RGB LED backlit keys for style, an aluminum base for strength, and mechanical brown switches for a good feel and great reaction speed. The almost universally gleeful reaction to a grenade that can seek out and destroy Mei anywhere on the map is understandable—even after she was temporarily disabled from the game because of an Ice Wall bug back in October 2022, she’s still an incredibly frustrating character in the hands of a good player. Her Ice Wall can block a moving point, cut off healers from injured players, and ruin quite a few ultimate abilities, and her Cryo-Freeze healing ability means she can often be tough to take down. “This fucking Mei” is practically an official Overwatch slogan at this point.Though Mei won’t be personally targeted by Cassidy’s Magnetic Grenade, Mercy players do still have to deal with the aftermath of her getting nerfed into the ground earlier this month. In happier news, Overwatch’s reworked matchmaking means I finally made Platinum support this week. Ranked really does suck less!",
    "United Launch Alliance is hoping that the Force will be with them on May 4, a date the company is hoping to launch its Vulcan heavy-lift rocket for the very first time. ULA chief executive Tory Bruno announced the tentative launch date for the Vulcan Centaur rocket  during a call with reporters on Thursday, adding that the timing of the rocket’s first flight still depends on a few remaining tests of the rocket and its engines, and the delivery of its payloads, SpaceNews reported. The rocket was supposed to launch in March, so this presents yet another delay.The highly anticipated inaugural flight will take place from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The company has a four-day window for liftoff to accommodate a payload that’s heading to the Moon; Vulcan is set to deliver Astrobotic’s Peregrine lunar lander, which, on behalf of NASA, will attempt to deliver 11  payloads to the lunar surface. This payload can only launch during specific times each month, hence the short windows.\xa0The rocket will also attempt to deliver the first two Amazon Kuiper internet satellites to low Earth orbit. Its third, and more bizarre, payload are locks of hair belonging to late presidents George Washington, Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan, in a space burial that’s being coordinated by the company Celestis.Colorado-based ULA had originally hoped to launch Vulcan in 2020, but its debut has been subject to several delays. The rocket’s first stage is powered by two BE-4 engines built by Blue Origin, a company owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Delivery of Blue Origin’s engine came more than four years late, but recent tests of the engines exposed a potential problem: a pump on one of the engines consistently produced about 5% more oxygen than expected, Bruno told reporters, and as relayed by Ars Technica. After further analysis, the engineers decided that it was a “unit-to-unit variation,” rather than something wrong with that engine, Bruno is quoted as saying.Keep it light and stay secure.This combination wall light and security camera from eufy offers nightvision, 2K picture, and over 3 weeks of local video storage with no hidden fee. Get it for $50 off on Amazon with code: WSWLCE50US.The two-stage rocket will roll out to the pad in a few days where it will undergo its final flight readiness tests that involve filling Vulcan with propellant and firing its BE-4 engines at about 70% of rate thrust. The company is expecting to conclude its tests by mid-April, at which point it will still need to wait until May 4 for the lunar lander’s launch window. Pending the success of its first mission, ULA is hoping to schedule in another Vulcan launch this year for Sierra Space’s Dream Chaser mission. The company needs to complete two Vulcan flights in order to get certified to launch U.S. military and intelligence satellites for the Space Force. ULA is under contract to deliver 35 missions for the U.S. Space Force in the next five years. Vulcan is also booked to launch more satellites for Amazon’s Kuiper project.“We have to ramp up,” Bruno told reporters on Thursday. “Before the end of 2025 we expect to be really at a tempo, which is flying a couple of times a month, every two weeks.”More: Pressed for Time, Amazon May Turn to Its SpaceX Rival for Satellite Launches",

    "Intel introduced its process node fabrication strategy a few years ago with an aggressive outline of hitting the 1nm process by 2025. The company has made many strides over the last year and a half, with the 7nm process available in the 12th and 13th generation core processors (Alder Lake and Raptor Lake series). The company has now revealed that it's ready to begin production and manufacturing of the next process technology, Intel 4, starting immediately.President of Intel China's Research Institute, Song Jiqiang, revealed at a recent meeting that the newest Intel 4 process is ready for manufacturing. Intel 4 is the successor to Intel 7 and will be incorporated into the next generation, codenamed Meteor Lake. The new 14th-generation core processors using the latest Intel 4 process technology are expected to be available in the second half of this year.Song continued to discuss that Intel 3 process technology and the following 20A / 18A process technologies are proceeding forward as planned by the company in its attempts at providing swift competition to semiconductor leaders, such as TSMC and Samsung.Intel 20A, which is the company's 2nm process technology, and 18A, the lecture for the company's 1.8nm process, are expected to enter the manufacturing phase next year in 2024. The 20A process node will present itself during the first quarter of 2024, followed by the 18A process in the second half. This move is crucial for Intel to reach the company's semiconductor spot by 2025.It is unknown what chip series 18A will be incorporated within, but the company has officially confirmed that the 20A process technology will be used for the codename \"Arrow Lake.\" In the disclosed slide, 18A is shown to be incorporated into future client-based \"Lake\" series chips, \"Rapids\" series data center chipsets, and foundry chips for Intel clients. It is also reported that Intel has already produced the first test chips on the 20A and 18A process nodes but it is not mentioned if these chips are internally designed by Intel or for a 3rd party client.The 20A and 18A process nodes will also introduce new RibbonFET and PowerVia technology for its chips. RibbonFET, known as 'ribbon field effect transistors,' succeeds FinFET technology. It is considered a gate-all-around (GAA) transistor with improved electrostatics compared to FinFET.PowerVia is a power delivery process that works in the backside to solve bottleneck issues within the interconnect seen in silicon architectures. It is a common problem that PowerVia should solve once it is available. Instead of interconnects transmitting data communication signals and power to the top of the transistor layer, Power Via will deliver directly to the backside of the silicon wafer while simultaneously transmitting signals on top of the wafer.News Source: Kuai Technology© 2023 WCCF TECH INC.

    "Most professional software these days has switched to expensive subscription-based models, but not Apple: Final Cut Pro still costs the same $299 it did when the app launched in 2011. Still, three hundred bucks ain’t cheap, leading some to seek, let’s say, “alternative” markets for the app. However, if you’re tempted to pirate Final Cut Pro for a free edit session, don’t: It’s too dangerous. As reported by 9to5Mac, cybersecurity company Jamf Threat Labs recently discovered malware within pirated copies of Final Cut Pro. This in and of itself isn’t necessarily a shock. Pirated software doesn’t come with the same security or protections you expect when downloading an app through an official outlet like the Mac App Store. Bad actors, then, take advantage of the situation, packing malware into popular apps to infect users looking for a free app. However, the malware Jamf Threat Labs discovered in pirated copies of Final Cut Pro isn’t necessarily designed to steal your information or break into your accounts. Rather, it’s crypto-mining (or crypto-jacking) malware, which can turn your power-efficient Mac into a chore to use. Mining for cryptocurrency demands a lot of resources, forcing miners to invest in both the equipment and the energy costs. Some, instead, choose to invest in other people for both: Once installed, crypto-mining malware hijacks your Mac’s processing power to mine cryptocurrency for the hacker’s benefit. That way, the hacker doesn’t need to invest any of their resources into crypto-mining rigs, and can outsource those tasks to their victims.Shop sales in every category.Uh-oh, overstock: Wayfair put their surplus on sale for up to 50% off.Good for them, bad for you. This type of malware, like all crypto-mining software, is demanding on your system, especially on your GPU, the chip that processes graphics on your computer. In fact, because so many crypto-miners were purchasing GPUs for their rigs, the price of GPUs shot up. There’s an incentive for bad actors to push the practices onto you, where you’ll experience all the system slow-downs and energy costs of the practice. Of course, the impact on your system isn’t the only motivation to avoid this situation. Unwittingly installing malware on your Mac is always bad. Nobody wants strange software on their machine—it’s the definition of an invasion of privacy, whether or not you notice the effects of it.Even more concerning in this specific case, Jamf Threat Labs found that macOS’ usual defenses weren’t catching the crypto-mining malware when it was installed on the user’s computer. That’s likely due to a clever trick by hackers, who have written a malicious version of Final Cut Pro that runs the open-source XMRig crypto-mining software in secret. Previous versions of this malware were less sneaky, first needing the user to enter their system password, and next requiring them to keep the app running for the malware to work. With this latest version, once the malicious Final  Cut Pro runs, the crypto-mining malware gets to work in the background, and doesn’t need Final Cut Pro opened to mine going forward. It knows you’re going to be concerned about your Mac slowing down, too: If you open Activity Monitor to investigate the program taking up so many resources, the malware shuts down until you quit Activity Monitor. Creepy, but perhaps keeping Activity Monitor running at all times is the best new anti-malware solution on the market.Final Cut Pro is just the latest pirated app found with this type of crypto-jacking malware, as Jamf Threat Labs discovered similar issues with pirated versions of Photoshop and Logic Pro. For Apple’s part, the company claims this malware family does not bypass their malware protections.Still, the news serves as a reminder that the internet still has a “Wild West” side, even in 2023.

    "Your guide to a better futureYou'll need a newer phone in order to get the full trade-in credit here, but it's worth considering either way.Samsung recently released the Galaxy S23 lineup and just as you'd expect with the new phone comes a bunch of deals and discounts to get people buying. We've highlighted all of the best Galaxy S23 deals already, but this particular offer from Samsung is so good that we wanted to make sure everyone saw it before it ended. The phone officially hit shelves on Feb. 17 and right now you can score a Galaxy S23 or S23 Plus for free with a trade-in and you can upgrade to the Galaxy S23 Ultra for $200 out of pocket.In order to get the phone for free, you're going to need to get one of the carrier versions, not the unlocked model. Verizon, T-Mobile and AT&T are all offering large trade-in credits towards the new phone and bill credits to slash the overall price to $0. As part of its preorder specials, Samsung did a free storage upgrade, scoring you the 256GB option for the price of the 128GB model, but unfortunately that has ended.The trade-in options do vary a little for each carrier, so you'll want to make sure that you check out all of the details on Samsung's site to ensure you pick the best option for you. The discounts here will likely be a mix of trade-in credit and monthly bill credits that are spread over the course of 24 to 36 months, depending on your carrier. If you want an unlocked model, you can get as much as $720 in trade-in credit towards the outright purchase of the new Galaxy S23 or S23 Plus models, meaning you can pay as little as $79 out of pocket for the new phones.All orders placed now will earn a free instant credit of up to $100 to use at Samsung. This can be used towards the purchase of Samsung Care Plus service or accessories for your new phone.\xa0Set price alerts on your favorite models with the CNET Shopping extension and get notified when prices drop.",
    "Always connected to the squad\r\nTo no one’s surprise, Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League is an always online game, even when playing alone without friendos. The news comes from an official FAQ page that reads, “Yes, an internet connection is required to play Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League solo or via online co-op.” It’s disappointing news, especially for those hoping to play Suicide Squad as a single-player experience with AI bots filling in for squadmates.\r\nIndeed, Suicide Squad isn't the only upcoming single-player/co-op game to require an always online internet connection. Redfall is another highly anticipated game that's gone down this route, as have many games before it, such as Red Dead Redemption 2 and IO Interactive's recent Hitman trilogy. It's a shame, especially when Suicide Squad gives you the option of having bots fill the roles of your villainous team mates - just like Left 4 Dead 2 did when playing offline. Back 4 Blood was an always-online game at launch, too, but the team at Turtle Rock ended up implementing an offline mode after players kicked off about this exact issue during the game's launch. Will Rocksteady dodge roll in the same direction? We'll have to wait and see. \r\n\r\nIn case you missed it, Suicide Squad received a chunky 15-minute segment during last night's State of Play stream from the folks at PlayStation, revealing it as yet another co-op looter shooter with ballooning Destiny-style stats and cosmetic battle passes. If it weren’t for all the gear and loot, I’d be quite excited for Suicide Squad. The action reminded me of other over-the-top shooters, in a good way. The gang’s floaty, unrealistically high jumps were giving me a hint of Crackdown, something that could be a good fit for the Suicide Squad’s temperament. \r\n\r\nWe’ll find out which way the game swings when Suicide Squad launches on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store on May 26th.\r\nYou're not signed in!Create your ReedPop ID & unlock community features and much, much more!Get each day's biggest PC gaming stories delivered direct to your inbox.\nKaan Serin\n\n          Contributor\n        Kaan is currently an English and Film student who spends more time thinking about food than his degree.

    "Mortal Kombat 12 is apparently launching this year, and that news was revealed rather unceremoniously\xa0in an earnings call with Warner Bros. Discovery.In a clip pulled from Warner Bros. Discovery's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call yesterday, Warner Bros. president and CEO David Zaslav\xa0states that “...there’s lots more to come, including the highly anticipated Mortal Kombat 12 and Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League, games also set for release this year with ambitious launch projections.” You can watch the clip in the embedded tweet below.\xa0Developer Netherrealm Studios has yet to announce anything on its end. Yesterday, studio head and Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon cheekily\xa0tweeted, “so who has heard the news about Injustice 3?”\xa0 referencing the fact that for years,\xa0Netherrealm has released an Injustice game between Mortal Kombat entries, so technically, that would be next if it maintained that pattern.\xa0Fans will have to wait for a flashier reveal, but a\xa0Mortal Kombat 12 launch would be huge for a year that already has Street Fighter 6 and potentially Tekken 8 on the schedule. Last October, Neththerrealm revealed\xa0Mortal Kombat: Onslaught, a role-playing mobile game also slated to release this year.\xa0Mortal Kombat 11 launched in 2019 to positive reviews (here’s ours).

    "Filed under:Quality of life in spaceKerbal Space Program may be one of the greatest pieces of edutainment ever created, and I don’t use that despicable portmanteau lightly. The space program and rocketry simulator gained a massive following for its dedication to real science, along with the endorsement of several space agencies and space launch companies around the world.Despite its accolades, Kerbal’s zeal for orbital trajectories and delta-V’s can be intimidating. It is, well, rocket science. For its sequel, though, developer Intercept Games clearly wanted to make these systems more approachable for new players — and new interactive tutorials go a long way toward that end.None of which is to say that the designers have dumbed the series down. Rest assured, that signature customizability and attention to scientific realism remains fully intact. Even though Kerbal Space Program 2 is designed to ease potential rocket scientists into their new obsession, the many quality-of-life improvements that Intercept Games has introduced are just as much a boon to those who already speak Kerbin.For starters, the game’s decade-old UI is greatly enhanced. Menus are more intuitively organized. Useful actions, like merging designs, aren’t buried inside other menus. Rocket parts are now color-coded by size, saving you tons of time when locating the necessary component. And not only is Kerbal 2’s UI just generally more approachable — it’s also much slicker than its predecessor, with a techy aesthetic and stark icons that don’t get in the way of readability.The actual act of rocket flying also benefits from this UI refresh. Attractive use of color and larger, clearer instrument panels work wonders in making the HUD feel more like a cockpit.Time warping has also been greatly improved. Like many simulation games, Kerbal Space Program lets you speed up time while hurtling through space, and because space is very, very big, you can speed it all the way up to a factor of 100,000x. The original game’s time warping was robust enough to handle all the physics simulations while fast-forwarding, unless your engines were firing. Any long-distance missions, like those that used efficient ion drives, were a slog. The sequel now lets you time warp while you’re accelerating, making the farthest-reaching missions much less boring. I suspect this will make interstellar missions, which require you to travel even greater distances after future updates, just as enjoyable. You can also completely pause the action mid-flight to troubleshoot problems.I also appreciate the small details that increase the thrill of launch: a Kerbinese countdown, jets of coolant water below the launch platform, and a rousing score that builds up to ignition. It remains to be seen how much of a leap the graphics will be over what was possible with the first game’s mods, but it certainly looks a lot prettier than the original base game. Vegetation! Dynamic lighting! Shinier rockets!Much like the original, Kerbal Space Program 2 is launching in early access, so not all of its features are available just yet. For now, the game is only a sandbox, with no campaign objectives or scientific research activities. I’ve also encountered a fair share of bugs. For instance, I was simply unable to load some of my campaign saves, so I’d recommend saving often! More frustratingly, the game locked up for around a second whenever I switched from rocket view to map view while piloting my rocket. Since I sometimes quickly hop between these two perspectives during critical maneuvers, this lag was especially annoying. The game also effectively locked up after one particular crash, making it incapable of booting up in the aftermath. The game wouldn’t launch without crashing, despite multiple restarts and a full reinstallation of the game, until it was made fully available this morning. Though I can cut a little slack to an early access title, this kind of instability is a big bummer. A lot of love and attention went toward improving Kerbal Space Program — I’m hopeful that will ring true again. But for now, that remains to be seen.However, if you’re content with a spacefaring sandbox in which you can painstakingly construct experimental rockets and (hopefully) launch them out of orbit, you’ll find a lot to love here. It’s a promising trajectory, and Intercept Games has already announced that future updates will include features completely new to the series, including space colonies and online multiplayer. For all of the hurdles that Kerbal Space Program required you to mount, it was a revelation once you made it to the other side. Kerbal Space Program 2 is already shortening those hurdles, and I can’t wait to see how many new rocket scientists it attracts. Kerbal Space Program 2 is available on Windows PC.
